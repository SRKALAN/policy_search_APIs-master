The Insured (or the Insured’s subsidiary companies) shall not cancel or restrict any Local Policy in force during the Period of Insurance of this insurance without the prior consent of the Company.  2. Interlocking Clause If a loss or series of losses arising out of the same Occurrence involves this Master Policy and any of the local policies issued by members of the Chubb Group of Insurance and Reinsurance Companies or by any other insurer as agreed by the Company and being hereinafter termed  ‘Programme Policies’, then the Limit of Liability of the Company in respect of all such losses combined regardless of the number of Programme Policies involved shall not exceed the Limit of Liability shown in this Policy or expressed elsewhere herein during any one Period of Insurance. Any loss paid under the Programme Policies shall reduce by such amount the Limit of Liability under this Policy. Nothing in this Policy shall serve to increase the Limit of Liability of this Policy or the Programme Policies, which shall be the maximum liability of the Company under all such policies. On exhaustion of the Limit of Liability, all cover under the Programme Policies shall cease. In respect of Property Damage and Business Interruption, Deductibles shall be applied separately, unless the policy specifies that the deductible for Property Damage and Business Interruption is combined. The liability of the Company in respect of any one Occurrence shall not exceed the Limit of Liability or Sub-limits of Liability as stated in the Schedule attached hereto in respect of this Master Policy and any other Programme Policies in respect of any Occurrence with regard to the corresponding peril, type of covered property or location, regardless of the number of locations or coverages involved. In the event that the total payments under the Programme Policies exceed the Limit of Liability of this Master Policy the Insured will reimburse the Company for the amount exceeding the Limit of Liability.  3. Insolvency of Local Insurer In the event of any claim being payable under any Local Policy and which is not settled solely by reason of the Insolvency of the insurer of such Local Policy then this Policy will operate to provide an indemnity but only to the extent that the Company would have accepted the claim had it been made under this Policy provided that: a if the insurer of such Local Policy is not an Affiliate of the Company any limit or amount under this Policy shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount retained by the insurer of such Local Policy or ceded to any entity other than the Company or any Affiliate of the Company whether or not any claim is made under such Local Policy b the Company shall not be liable to pay the amount of any deductible excess or other self-insurance that would have applied under such Local Policy  c this Multinational Condition does not apply in respect of any claim by any liquidator receiver or successor entity to any insurer of such Local Policy d in the event a settlement is made to the Insured under such Local Policy in respect of which a settlement is also made by the Company under this Multinational Condition a sum equivalent to such settlement shall immediately be reimbursed to the Company by the Insured e in the event of any occurrence giving rise to or which may give rise to a claim under this Multinational Condition the Insured shall: 1) give immediate written notice to the Company as soon as the Insured becomes aware of the Insolvency of any insurer of such Local Policy  2) pursue all rights available under such Local Policy and take all reasonable steps to ensure that the Insured under the Local Policy pursues all rights available under such Local Policy  3) comply with all duties and obligations under this Policy and take all necessary steps to ensure that the Insured under the Local Policy complies with all duties and obligations under such Local Policy 4) at the request of the Company submit a sworn statement of loss even if such a statement has already been submitted by the Insured under the Local Policy 5) give all such information and assistance as the Company may require and take all necessary steps to obtain for the Company’s benefit all possible recoveries and indemnities available from any other source. The following additional Definitions apply to this Condition: Insolvency means an adjudicated bankruptcy or insolvency of the insurer of any Local Policy or a refusal or inability to pay within a reasonable amount of time from the date of a final judgement or settlement that determines the amount the insurer of such Local Policy is legally obligated to pay.

Payment of Claims Any claim payable under this Policy will be paid in the currency of the claim or in such other currency as the Company and the Insured agree at the prevailing free exchange rate on the day that the Company and the Insured agree to settle the claim.  2. Reinstatement If the Company elects or becomes bound to reinstate, replace or repair any Property Insured the Insured shall at their own expense produce and give to the Company all such plans, documents, books and information as the Company may reasonably require. The Company shall not be bound to reinstate or replace exactly or completely, but only as circumstances permit and in reasonably sufficient manner and shall not in any case be bound to expend in respect of any one of the items insured more than the sum insured thereon.  3. Company’s Rights On the happening of any loss, destruction or damage in respect of which a claim is or may be made under this Policy the Company and any person authorised by the Company may, without thereby incurring any liability, and without diminishing the right of the Company to rely upon any conditions of this Policy, enter, take or keep possession of the Building or Premises where the loss, destruction or damage has happened and may take possession of or require to be delivered to it any of the property hereby insured and may keep possession of and deal with such Property Insured for all reasonable purposes and in any reasonable manner. This Special Provision shall be evidence of the leave and licence of the Insured to the Company so to do. If the Insured or anyone acting on their behalf shall not comply with the requirements of the Company or shall hinder or obstruct the Company in doing any of the above mentioned acts, then all benefit under this insurance shall be forfeited. The Insured shall not in any case be entitled to abandon any property to the Company whether taken possession of by the Company or not. If any other insurance effected by or on behalf of the Insured is expressed to cover any of the Property Insured hereby, but is subject to any provision whereby it is excluded from ranking concurrently with this insurance either in whole or in part or from contributing rateably to the loss, destruction or damage the liability of the Company shall be limited to such proportion of the loss, destruction or damage as the sum insured hereby bears to the value of such Property Insured.  4. Deductible Application Unless otherwise stated:- a if two or more Deductibles apply to a single Occurrence, the total to be deducted will not exceed the largest deductible applicable, unless otherwise provided; b Property Damage Value shall mean the value of Property Insured at the location of a loss, calculated in accordance with the Basis of Valuation;  c Business Interruption Value shall mean:-  i. the estimated Gross Profit that would have been earned at the premises but for the Occurrence if such Premises are insured for Gross Profit; ii. the estimated Gross Revenue that would have been earned at the premises but for the Occurrence if such Premises are insured for Gross Revenue; iii. the applicable Increase in Cost of Working limit if such Premises are insured only for Increase in Cost of Working or are not claiming for loss of Gross Profit  or Gross Revenue or under the Rent item if included as part of a claim; d in the event of loss involving Local Policy(s) and this Policy, the Deductible applicable hereunder shall be reduced by the amount of deductible payable under such Local Policy(s).  Should the amount of deductible under such Local Policy(s) exceed the applicable Deductible under this Policy, then no deducible shall apply hereunder.  However, if the deductible paid under such Local Policy(s) is less than the applicable Deductible under this Policy, then the amount to be deducted hereunder shall be the difference between the deductible paid under the Local Policy(s) and the applicable Deductible under this Policy.  Only those losses covered under both the Local Policy(s) as well as this Policy shall be subject to this paragraph d;  e where a Deductible is expressed as a percentage, if no claim is made under Section 2 – Business Interruption of this Policy in respect of an Occurrence, Business Interruption values will not be included in the calculation of the Deductible for that Occurrence.

Master Policy - Maintenance of Local Policies This Policy acts as the Master Policy in respect of insurance provided under the Local Policies, provided that, subject to its terms, conditions and exclusions, the Insured shall, in each country in which any of the Property Insured or Interests Insured, is located, maintain in full effect during the Period of Insurance of this Policy a policy or policies of insurance protecting such property and/or interests against such of the perils insured in the respective Sections of this Policy hereunder as is obtainable in such country unless otherwise agreed with the Company, each such Policy being issued by members of the Chubb Group of Insurance and Reinsurance Companies (or by other insurers as agreed by the Company) and being hereinafter termed a “Local Policy”. The Insured (or the Insured’s subsidiary companies) shall not cancel or restrict any Local Policy in force during the Period of Insurance of this insurance without the prior consent of the Company.  2. Interlocking Clause If a loss or series of losses arising out of the same Occurrence involves this Master Policy and any of the local policies issued by members of the Chubb Group of Insurance and Reinsurance Companies or by any other insurer as agreed by the Company and being hereinafter termed  ‘Programme Policies’, then the Limit of Liability of the Company in respect of all such losses combined regardless of the number of Programme Policies involved shall not exceed the Limit of Liability shown in this Policy or expressed elsewhere herein during any one Period of Insurance. Any loss paid under the Programme Policies shall reduce by such amount the Limit of Liability under this Policy. Nothing in this Policy shall serve to increase the Limit of Liability of this Policy or the Programme Policies, which shall be the maximum liability of the Company under all such policies. On exhaustion of the Limit of Liability, all cover under the Programme Policies shall cease. In respect of Property Damage and Business Interruption, Deductibles shall be applied separately, unless the policy specifies that the deductible for Property Damage and Business Interruption is combined. The liability of the Company in respect of any one Occurrence shall not exceed the Limit of Liability or Sub-limits of Liability as stated in the Schedule attached hereto in respect of this Master Policy and any other Programme Policies in respect of any Occurrence with regard to the corresponding peril, type of covered property or location, regardless of the number of locations or coverages involved. In the event that the total payments under the Programme Policies exceed the Limit of Liability of this Master Policy the Insured will reimburse the Company for the amount exceeding the Limit of Liability.  3. Insolvency of Local Insurer In the event of any claim being payable under any Local Policy and which is not settled solely by reason of the Insolvency of the insurer of such Local Policy then this Policy will operate to provide an indemnity but only to the extent that the Company would have accepted the claim had it been made under this Policy provided that: a if the insurer of such Local Policy is not an Affiliate of the Company any limit or amount under this Policy shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount retained by the insurer of such Local Policy or ceded to any entity other than the Company or any Affiliate of the Company whether or not any claim is made under such Local Policy b the Company shall not be liable to pay the amount of any deductible excess or other self-insurance that would have applied under such Local Policy  c this Multinational Condition does not apply in respect of any claim by any liquidator receiver or successor entity to any insurer of such Local Policy d in the event a settlement is made to the Insured under such Local Policy in respect of which a settlement is also made by the Company under this Multinational Condition a sum equivalent to such settlement shall immediately be reimbursed to the Company by the Insured e in the event of any occurrence giving rise to or which may give rise to a claim under this Multinational Condition the Insured shall: 1) give immediate written notice to the Company as soon as the Insured becomes aware of the Insolvency of any insurer of such Local Policy  2) pursue all rights available under such Local Policy and take all reasonable steps to ensure that the Insured under the Local Policy pursues all rights available under such Local Policy  3) comply with all duties and obligations under this Policy and take all necessary steps to ensure that the Insured under the Local Policy complies with all duties and obligations under such Local Policy 4) at the request of the Company submit a sworn statement of loss even if such a statement has already been submitted by the Insured under the Local Policy 5) give all such information and assistance as the Company may require and take all necessary steps to obtain for the Company’s benefit all possible recoveries and indemnities available from any other source. The following additional Definitions apply to this Condition: Insolvency means an adjudicated bankruptcy or insolvency of the insurer of any Local Policy or a refusal or inability to pay within a reasonable amount of time from the date of a final judgement or settlement that determines the amount the insurer of such Local Policy is legally obligated to pay. Affiliate means any company within the Chubb Group of Companies with Chubb Limited as its ultimate holding company. Local Policy means a policy or policies of insurance protecting such property and/or interests against such of the perils insured hereunder as is obtainable in such country, each such policy being issued by members of the Chubb Group of Insurance and Reinsurance Companies (or by other insurers as agreed by the Company).  4. Foreign Entity Loss Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary: a the Company will indemnify the First Named Insured for an Insured Loss, the value of which is conclusively agreed and shall be equal to: 1) where at the time of the Foreign Entity Loss the Ownership Interest is a Controlling Interest, the Foreign Entity Loss; or 2) subject to b below, where at the time of the Foreign Entity Loss the Ownership Interest is not a Controlling Interest, the Ownership Interest multiplied by the Foreign Entity Loss provided that the values have been declared to the Company and the appropriate premium paid. b if, at the date of the Foreign Entity Loss: 1) the First Named Insured does not have an Ownership Interest or has an Ownership Interest which is not a Controlling Interest but the First Named Insured or an intervening subsidiary is responsible: i. for reimbursing the Foreign Entity for the Foreign Entity Loss; or ii. for obtaining property insurance for the Foreign Entity pursuant to some form of responsibility which the First Named Insured or an intervening subsidiary has in relation to the property or to the Foreign Entity; or 2) the First Named Insured has an Ownership Interest which is not a Controlling Interest and the First Named Insured or an intervening subsidiary is responsible for obtaining property insurance for the Foreign Entity, (an “Obligation”),  the Company will indemnify the First Named Insured for the Insured Loss, the value of which is agreed and shall be deemed conclusively to be equal to the Foreign Entity Loss to the extent that the First Named Insured has an Obligation to pay. c The Company will treat any Foreign Entity Loss in accordance with all of the terms and conditions of this Policy, including, but not limited to, exclusions and other limitations in this Policy, as if the Foreign Entity Loss occurred to the First Named Insured. d Information material to this insurance which is known to the Foreign Entity shall be deemed to be known to the First Named Insured. e The First Named Insured shall, when directed by the Company: 1 retain in its own name, but at the Company’s expense, a loss adjusting expert (“loss adjuster”), authorised in the jurisdiction in which the Foreign Entity Loss occurred and approved by the Company, to adjust the Foreign Entity Loss; 2 where permitted by applicable law, grant the Company the full right to collaborate with such loss adjuster;  3 grant the Company full access to any records produced by such loss adjuster; and  4 obtain the right to control the investigation, adjustment, defence and settlement of a Foreign Entity Loss, including access to books, records, bills invoices, vouchers and other information. f The First Named Insured shall make best endeavours to ensure that the Foreign Entity shall, to the extent permitted by the laws and/or regulations to which the Foreign Entity is subject,  do and concur in doing and permit to be done all such acts and things as may be necessary or reasonably required by the Company for the purpose of enforcing any rights and remedies, or of obtaining relief, indemnity or settlement sums from other parties in each case in priority to the insurer with whom the Local Policy is written. In the event any such recovery is subsequently received by the Foreign Entity in respect of which a payment or settlement is or has been made by the Company to the First Named Insured  in relation to the Foreign Entity Loss, the First Named Insured shall immediately pay to the Company a sum equivalent to such payment or settlement. For the purpose of this Multinational Condition the following Definitions apply:   “First Named Insured” means the Insured named first in the Schedule.   “Foreign Entity” means an entity (located in a country or territory in which the Company is not lawfully permitted to insure that entity) in which the First Named Insured has an economic interest as a result either of benefiting financially from the continued operation of the Foreign Entity or of being prejudiced by loss or damage to or liability of a Foreign Entity or its business or for which the First Named Insured is responsible for arranging property insurance. “Foreign Entity Loss” means any loss incurred or paid by the Foreign Entity, which would be considered a covered loss under the terms and conditions of this Policy, including but not limited to all exclusions and limitations.  “Insured Loss” means the decrease in the value of the economic interest of the First Named Insured in the Foreign Entity as a result of the Foreign Entity Loss. “Ownership Interest” means the percentage ownership interest that the First Named Insured has in the Foreign Entity, either directly or through intervening subsidiaries.  “Controlling Interest” means  an Ownership Interest which is either i. greater than 50 per cent. or ii. greater than 15 per cent provided it is the largest shareholding in a Foreign Entity.

Master Policy - Maintenance of Local Policies This Policy acts as the Master Policy in respect of insurance provided under the Local Policies, provided that, subject to its terms, conditions and exclusions, the Insured shall, in each country in which any of the Property Insured or Interests Insured, is located, maintain in full effect during the Period of Insurance of this Policy a policy or policies of insurance protecting such property and/or interests against such of the perils insured in the respective Sections of this Policy hereunder as is obtainable in such country unless otherwise agreed with the Company, each such Policy being issued by members of the Chubb Group of Insurance and Reinsurance Companies (or by other insurers as agreed by the Company) and being hereinafter termed a “Local Policy”. The Insured (or the Insured’s subsidiary companies) shall not cancel or restrict any Local Policy in force during the Period of Insurance of this insurance without the prior consent of the Company.  2. Interlocking Clause If a loss or series of losses arising out of the same Occurrence involves this Master Policy and any of the local policies issued by members of the Chubb Group of Insurance and Reinsurance Companies or by any other insurer as agreed by the Company and being hereinafter termed  ‘Programme Policies’, then the Limit of Liability of the Company in respect of all such losses combined regardless of the number of Programme Policies involved shall not exceed the Limit of Liability shown in this Policy or expressed elsewhere herein during any one Period of Insurance. Any loss paid under the Programme Policies shall reduce by such amount the Limit of Liability under this Policy. Nothing in this Policy shall serve to increase the Limit of Liability of this Policy or the Programme Policies, which shall be the maximum liability of the Company under all such policies. On exhaustion of the Limit of Liability, all cover under the Programme Policies shall cease. In respect of Property Damage and Business Interruption, Deductibles shall be applied separately, unless the policy specifies that the deductible for Property Damage and Business Interruption is combined. The liability of the Company in respect of any one Occurrence shall not exceed the Limit of Liability or Sub-limits of Liability as stated in the Schedule attached hereto in respect of this Master Policy and any other Programme Policies in respect of any Occurrence with regard to the corresponding peril, type of covered property or location, regardless of the number of locations or coverages involved. In the event that the total payments under the Programme Policies exceed the Limit of Liability of this Master Policy the Insured will reimburse the Company for the amount exceeding the Limit of Liability.  3. Insolvency of Local Insurer In the event of any claim being payable under any Local Policy and which is not settled solely by reason of the Insolvency of the insurer of such Local Policy then this Policy will operate to provide an indemnity but only to the extent that the Company would have accepted the claim had it been made under this Policy provided that: a if the insurer of such Local Policy is not an Affiliate of the Company any limit or amount under this Policy shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount retained by the insurer of such Local Policy or ceded to any entity other than the Company or any Affiliate of the Company whether or not any claim is made under such Local Policy b the Company shall not be liable to pay the amount of any deductible excess or other self-insurance that would have applied under such Local Policy  c this Multinational Condition does not apply in respect of any claim by any liquidator receiver or successor entity to any insurer of such Local Policy d in the event a settlement is made to the Insured under such Local Policy in respect of which a settlement is also made by the Company under this Multinational Condition a sum equivalent to such settlement shall immediately be reimbursed to the Company by the Insured e in the event of any occurrence giving rise to or which may give rise to a claim under this Multinational Condition the Insured shall: 1) give immediate written notice to the Company as soon as the Insured becomes aware of the Insolvency of any insurer of such Local Policy  2) pursue all rights available under such Local Policy and take all reasonable steps to ensure that the Insured under the Local Policy pursues all rights available under such Local Policy  3) comply with all duties and obligations under this Policy and take all necessary steps to ensure that the Insured under the Local Policy complies with all duties and obligations under such Local Policy 4) at the request of the Company submit a sworn statement of loss even if such a statement has already been submitted by the Insured under the Local Policy 5) give all such information and assistance as the Company may require and take all necessary steps to obtain for the Company’s benefit all possible recoveries and indemnities available from any other source. The following additional Definitions apply to this Condition: Insolvency means an adjudicated bankruptcy or insolvency of the insurer of any Local Policy or a refusal or inability to pay within a reasonable amount of time from the date of a final judgement or settlement that determines the amount the insurer of such Local Policy is legally obligated to pay.

      "  Multinational Conditions 1. Master Policy - Maintenance of Local Policies This Policy acts as the Master Policy in respect of insurance provided under the Local Policies, provided that, subject to its terms, conditions and exclusions, the Insured shall, in each country in which any of the Property Insured or Interests Insured, is located, maintain in full effect during the Period of Insurance of this Policy a policy or policies of insurance protecting such property and/or interests against such of the perils insured in the respective Sections of this Policy hereunder as is obtainable in such country unless otherwise agreed with the Company, each such Policy being issued by members of the Chubb Group of Insurance and Reinsurance Companies (or by other insurers as agreed by the Company) and being hereinafter termed a “Local Policy”. The Insured (or the Insured’s subsidiary companies) shall not cancel or restrict any Local Policy in force during the Period of Insurance of this insurance without the prior consent of the Company.  2. Interlocking Clause If a loss or series of losses arising out of the same Occurrence involves this Master Policy and any of the local policies issued by members of the Chubb Group of Insurance and Reinsurance Companies or by any other insurer as agreed by the Company and being hereinafter termed  ‘Programme Policies’, then the Limit of Liability of the Company in respect of all such losses combined regardless of the number of Programme Policies involved shall not exceed the Limit of Liability shown in this Policy or expressed elsewhere herein during any one Period of Insurance. Any loss paid under the Programme Policies shall reduce by such amount the Limit of Liability under this Policy. Nothing in this Policy shall serve to increase the Limit of Liability of this Policy or the Programme Policies, which shall be the maximum liability of the Company under all such policies. On exhaustion of the Limit of Liability, all cover under the Programme Policies shall cease. In respect of Property Damage and Business Interruption, Deductibles shall be applied separately, unless the policy specifies that the deductible for Property Damage and Business Interruption is combined. The liability of the Company in respect of any one Occurrence shall not exceed the Limit of Liability or Sub-limits of Liability as stated in the Schedule attached hereto in respect of this Master Policy and any other Programme Policies in respect of any Occurrence with regard to the corresponding peril, type of covered property or location, regardless of the number of locations or coverages involved. In the event that the total payments under the Programme Policies exceed the Limit of Liability of this Master Policy the Insured will reimburse the Company for the amount exceeding the Limit of Liability.  3. Insolvency of Local Insurer In the event of any claim being payable under any Local Policy and which is not settled solely by reason of the Insolvency of the insurer of such Local Policy then this Policy will operate to provide an indemnity but only to the extent that the Company would have accepted the claim had it been made under this Policy provided that: a if the insurer of such Local Policy is not an Affiliate of the Company any limit or amount under this Policy shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount retained by the insurer of such Local Policy or ceded to any entity other than the Company or any Affiliate of the Company whether or not any claim is made under such Local Policy b the Company shall not be liable to pay the amount of any deductible excess or other self-insurance that would have applied under such Local Policy  c this Multinational Condition does not apply in respect of any claim by any liquidator receiver or successor entity to any insurer of such Local Policy d in the event a settlement is made to the Insured under such Local Policy in respect of which a settlement is also made by the Company under this Multinational Condition a sum equivalent to such settlement shall immediately be reimbursed to the Company by the Insured e in the event of any occurrence giving rise to or which may give rise to a claim under this Multinational Condition the Insured shall: 1) give immediate written notice to the Company as soon as the Insured becomes aware of the Insolvency of any insurer of such Local Policy  2) pursue all rights available under such Local Policy and take all reasonable steps to ensure that the Insured under the Local Policy pursues all rights available under such Local Policy  3) comply with all duties and obligations under this Policy and take all necessary steps to ensure that the Insured under the Local Policy complies with all duties and obligations under such Local Policy 4) at the request of the Company submit a sworn statement of loss even if such a statement has already been submitted by the Insured under the Local Policy 5) give all such information and assistance as the Company may require and take all necessary steps to obtain for the Company’s benefit all possible recoveries and indemnities available from any other source. The following additional Definitions apply to this Condition: Insolvency means an adjudicated bankruptcy or insolvency of the insurer of any Local Policy or a refusal or inability to pay within a reasonable amount of time from the date of a final judgement or settlement that determines the amount the insurer of such Local Policy is legally obligated to pay.
