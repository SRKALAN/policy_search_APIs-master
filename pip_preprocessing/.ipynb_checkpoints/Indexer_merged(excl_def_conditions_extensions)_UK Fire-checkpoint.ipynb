      "4.  Goods and Services Tax – how it affects any payments We make 6.  Excess  The amount of Premium payable by You for this Policy includes an  amount on account of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the  Premium. When We pay a claim, Your GST status will determine the amount We  pay. When You are: a.   not registered for GST We will pay up to the Sum Insured, Limit  of Liability or other Policy limit including GST. b.  registered for GST:       i.   and We settle direct with the builder, repairer or supplier  We will pay up to the Sum Insured, Limit of Liability or other  Policy limit including GST; or ii.   when We settle direct with You We will pay up to the Sum  Insured, Limit of Liability or other Policy limit and iii.   where You are liable to pay an amount for GST in respect of  an acquisition relevant to Your claim We will pay for the GST  amount but We will reduce the GST amount We pay by the  amount of any Input Tax Credits to which You are or would  be entitled. In these circumstances, the Input Tax Credit may be claimable  through Your Business Activity Statement (BAS). You must advise Us of Your correct Australian Business Number &  Taxable Percentage. Any GST liability arising from Your incorrect  advice is payable by You. Where the settlement of Your claim is less than the Sum Insured or  the other limits of insurance cover, We will only pay an amount for  GST (less Your entitlement for Input Tax Credit) applicable to the  settlement. This means that if these amounts are not sufficient to  cover Your loss, We will only pay the GST relating to Our settlement of  the claim. GST, Input Tax Credit (ITC), Business Activity Statement (BAS) and  Acquisition have the same meaning as given to those expressions in  A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth) and related  legislation as amended from time to time. Taxable Percentage is Your  entitlement to an Input Tax Credit on Your Premium as a percentage  of the total GST on that Premium. There may be other taxation implications affecting You, depending  upon Your own circumstances. We recommend that You seek  professional advice. 5.  Joint insureds When more than one party is named on the Schedule as an insured  We will treat each as a separate and distinct party. The words You,  Your, Yours will apply to each party in the same manner as if a  separate Policy had been issued to each party, provided Our liability  for any Sum Insured, Limit of Liability or other Policy limit for any one  Event or Occurrence is not thereby increased. Any act, breach or non- compliance with the terms and conditions of this Policy committed  by any one such party shall not be prejudicial to the rights and  entitlements of the other insured party(ies), provided that the other  insured party(ies) upon becoming aware of any such act, breach or  non-compliance which increases the risk of loss, damage or liability  give Us written notice within a reasonable time. 12 QM562-0619 | Policy Wording / General Conditions You must pay or contribute the amount of any Excess shown in this  Policy or in the Schedule for each claim made. Payment of the Excess  may be requested when the claim is lodged, or may be deducted from  Our payment. With the exception of the Earthquake Excess as shown below, should  more than one Excess be payable for any claim arising from the one  Event, such Excesses will not be aggregated and the highest single  level of Excess only will apply. The Excess You have to pay or contribute to earthquake or  seismological disturbance as shown in the Schedule applies for  an Event that occurs during any one period of seventy-two (72)  consecutive hours.   7.  Reinstatement of Sum Insured After We have admitted liability for a claim We will automatically  reinstate the Sum Insured and/or Special Benefit limits to their pre- loss amount without any additional Premium having to be paid. This condition does not apply: a.  when We pay a total loss; b.  when We pay the full Sum Insured; c.  to Policy 6 – Office Bearers’ Legal Liability d.   to Policy 9 – Government Audit Costs, Appeal Expenses and  Legal Defence Expenses; e.  to Special Benefits 6 and 23 of Policy 1 – Insured Property. 8.  Governing law and jurisdiction This Policy is governed by the laws of the State or Territory of Australia  in which this Policy is issued. Any dispute relating to this Policy shall  be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of an Australian Court within  the State or Territory in which this Policy was issued. 9.   Subrogation, recovery action & uninsured loss We may at any time, at Our expense and in Your name, use all legal  means available to You of securing reimbursement for loss or damage  arising under Your Policy. In the event We do so, You agree to give all  reasonable assistance for that purpose. If You have suffered loss that was not covered by the Policy as a result  of the incident, We may offer to attempt to recover this. You may also  specifically ask Us to recover this for You. You will need to give Us documents supporting Your loss. Before We  include any uninsured loss in the recovery action We will also ask You  to agree to the basis on which We will handle Your recovery action. You  may need to contribute to legal costs in some circumstances. 10.  Related Claims For the purposes of applying any Excess or Limit of Liability, all loss  otherwise recoverable under this Policy resulting from or in connection  with: a.  one and the same act error or omission; or b.   a series of acts, errors or omissions arising out of or  attributable to the same originating cause, or source; will be  deemed to be one claim. 11.

All such fees and expenses actually recovered will be taken into  account when calculating Our liability.

Basis of Settlement    For the purpose of this Clause 4:  4.1  Reinstatement  Value  is  the  cost  necessary  to  replace,  repair  or  rebuild  the  Property  Insured to a condition substantially the same as, but not better or more extensive than, its  condition when new.  4.2  Indemnity Value is:  4.2.1  where the Damage to any Property Insured can be repaired, the cost that would  necessarily  be  incurred  to  restore  the  property  to  a  condition  substantially  the  same as, but not better or more extensive than, its condition at the time that the  Damage  occurred  taking  into  consideration  age,  condition  and  remaining  useful  life,  including  the  cost  of  dismantling  and  re-erection  incurred  for the purpose of  effecting  the  repairs.
