      "                                  Policy Terms and Conditions for Broadform Liability Policy  Insurer  Our Agreement with You  This Policy is a legal contract between You and Us. You pay Us the premium, and We provide You with the  cover You have chosen as set out in the Policy, occurring during the Period of Insurance shown on Your Policy  Schedule or any renewal period.  Words importing persons shall include corporations and other legal entities. The singular includes references  to the plural and vice versa. Headings, wherever appearing in this Policy, have been included for ease of  reference and shall not be used for interpretation purposes.  You (being the insured party named first in the Policy Schedule) having submitted a Proposal containing  particulars for the purpose of obtaining this insurance and having paid or agreed to pay the premium specified  in the Policy Schedule, We agree, subject to the terms, provisions, limitations, exclusions, and conditions  contained in or endorsed on or otherwise expressed in the Policy, to provide insurance in the manner and to  the extent hereinafter provided.  The amount of any Deductible that applies to Your Policy will be shown on Your Policy Schedule.  The exclusions in the section(s) headed ‘When you are not covered’ and conditions in the section headed  ‘General Conditions’ apply to all sections of this Policy.  You must tell Us of the interests of all parties (e.g. financiers, owners, lessors) who will be covered by this  insurance. We will protect their interests only if You have told us about them and We have noted them on  Your Policy Schedule.  Other Party’s Interests  Paying your Premium  You must pay Your premium by the due date. If We do not receive Your premium by this date or Your  payment is dishonoured this Policy will not operate and there will be no cover.  Preventing our Right of Recovery  If You have agreed not to seek compensation from another person who is liable to compensate You for any  loss, damage or liability which is covered by this Policy, We will not cover You under this Policy for that loss,  damage or liability except where we agree otherwise under the Contractual Liability Exclusion (clause 5.4),  including Incidental Contracts (clause 4.11), or under the Subrogation Waiver (clause 6.9) or in writing.  How Goods and Services Tax affects any Payments we make  The amount of premium payable by You for this Policy includes an amount on account of the GST on the  premium.  When We pay a claim, Your GST status will determine the amount We pay. When You are:  •  •  not registered for GST, the amount We pay is the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance cover  including GST.  registered for GST, We will pay the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance and where You are  liable to pay an amount for GST in respect of an acquisition relevant to Your claim, We will pay for the  GST amount.  We will reduce the GST amount We pay for by the amount of any input tax credits to which You are or would  be entitled if You made a relevant acquisition. In these circumstances, the input tax credit may be claimable  through Your business activity statement (BAS). You must advise Us of Your correct Australian business  number and taxable percentage.    Austbrokers Broadform Liability Insurance Policy.  ©2019 Chubb Insurance Australia Limited.

      "                    Any GST liability arising from Your incorrect advice is payable by You. Where the settlement of Your claim is  less than the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance cover, We will only pay an amount for GST (less  Your entitlement for input tax credit) applicable to the settlement. This means that if these amounts are not  sufficient to cover Your loss, We will only pay the GST relating to Our settlement of the claim.  We will (where relevant) pay You on Your claim by reference to the GST-exclusive amount of any supply made  by any Business of Yours which is relevant to Your claim.  GST, input tax credit (ITC), business activity statement (BAS) and acquisition have the same meaning as given  to those expressions in A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 and related legislation as  amended from time to time.  Taxable percentage is Your entitlement to an input tax credit on Your premium as a percentage of the total  GST on that premium.

      "  •  •      Policy Terms and Conditions for Broadform Liability Policy  Insurer  Our Agreement with You  This Policy is a legal contract between You and Us. You pay Us the premium, and We provide You with the  cover You have chosen as set out in the Policy, occurring during the Period of Insurance shown on Your Policy  Schedule or any renewal period.  Words importing persons shall include corporations and other legal entities. The singular includes references  to the plural and vice versa. Headings, wherever appearing in this Policy, have been included for ease of  reference and shall not be used for interpretation purposes.  You (being the insured party named first in the Policy Schedule) having submitted a Proposal containing  particulars for the purpose of obtaining this insurance and having paid or agreed to pay the premium specified  in the Policy Schedule, We agree, subject to the terms, provisions, limitations, exclusions, and conditions  contained in or endorsed on or otherwise expressed in the Policy, to provide insurance in the manner and to  the extent hereinafter provided.  The amount of any Deductible that applies to Your Policy will be shown on Your Policy Schedule.   The exclusions in the section(s) headed ‘When you are not covered’ and conditions in the section headed  ‘General Conditions’ apply to all sections of this Policy.   You must tell Us of the interests of all parties (e.g. financiers, owners, lessors) who will be covered by this  insurance. We will protect their interests only if You have told us about them and We have noted them on  Your Policy Schedule.  Other Party’s Interests  Paying your Premium  You must pay Your premium by the due date. If We do not receive Your premium by this date or Your  payment is dishonoured this Policy will not operate and there will be no cover.  Preventing our Right of Recovery  If You have agreed not to seek compensation from another person who is liable to compensate You for any  loss, damage or liability which is covered by this Policy, We will not cover You under this Policy for that loss,  damage or liability except where we agree otherwise under the Contractual Liability Exclusion (clause 5.4),  including Incidental Contracts (clause 4.11), or under the Subrogation Waiver (clause 6.9) or in writing.   How Goods and Services Tax affects any Payments we make   The amount of premium payable by You for this Policy includes an amount on account of the GST on the  premium.  When We pay a claim, Your GST status will determine the amount We pay. When You are:  not registered for GST, the amount We pay is the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance cover  including GST.  registered for GST, We will pay the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance and where You are  liable to pay an amount for GST in respect of an acquisition relevant to Your claim, We will pay for the  GST amount.  We will reduce the GST amount We pay for by the amount of any input tax credits to which You are or would  be entitled if You made a relevant acquisition. In these circumstances, the inpu t tax credit may be claimable  through Your business activity statement (BAS). You must advise Us of Your correct Australian business  number and taxable percentage.  Austbrokers  Broadform Liability Insurance  Policy (Chubb02-94-0217).  ©2019 Chubb  Insurance  Australia Limited.  Chubb®,  its logos, and Chubb.Insured.SM  are protected  trademarks of Chubb.    1    Any GST liability arising from Your incorrect advice is payable by You. Where the settlement of Your claim is  less than the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance cover, We will only pay an amount for GST (less  Your entitlement for input tax credit) applicable to the settlement. This means that if these amounts are not  sufficient to cover Your loss, We will only pay the GST relating to Our settlement of the claim.   We will (where relevant) pay You on Your claim by reference to the GST-exclusive amount of any supply made  by any Business of Yours which is relevant to Your claim.   GST, input tax credit (ITC), business activity statement (BAS) and acquisition have the same meaning as given  to those expressions in A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 and related legislation as  amended from time to time.  Taxable percentage is Your entitlement to an input tax credit on Your premium as a percentage of the total  GST on that premium.  We will cover You for Your legal liability to pay all sums by way of compensation, and all costs awarded  against You in respect of:  1.  What you are insured against  1.1  Liability  •  Personal Injury  •  Property Damage  •  Advertising Liability  1.2  Additional Payments  If We agree to cover You We will:   happening during the Period of Insurance and caused by an Occurrence within the Territorial Limits in  connection with Your Business or Products.  a)  defend in Your name and on Your behalf any claim or legal action against You seeking damages for  Personal Injury, Property Damage or Advertising Liability even if the action is groundless, false or  fraudulent, and We will investigate, negotiate and settle any claim or legal action as We see fit,   b)  pay all legal costs and expenses incurred by Us and all interest accruing after entry of judgement  until We have paid, tendered or deposited in court such part of the judgement as does not exceed  the Limit of Liability,  reimburse You for all reasonable expenses, including loss of salaries and wages incurred by You  with Our consent, which shall not be  unreasonably withheld in connection with the defence of a  claim or legal action,  c)  d)  pay all legal costs incurred by you with our consent for Your any solicitor, defence counsel or the  equivalent thereof for representation at any inquest, fatal inquiry or other proceedings in  connection with any alleged breach of statutory duty relating to an occurrence which may give rise  to a claim for compensation under this Policy,   e)  pay premiums on:  i.  ii.  bonds to release attachments for amounts not exceeding the applicable Limit of Liability of  this Policy but We shall have no obligation to apply for or furnish any such bond;   appeal bonds and/or security for costs required in any suit but We shall have no obligation to  apply for or furnish any such bonds and/or security for costs;  f)  pay reasonable expenses incurred by You for first aid to others at the time of Personal Injury  caused by an Occurrence (other than medical expenses prohibited by Section 126 of the Health  Insurance Act 1973),  g)  pay all costs incurred by You for temporary repairs, shoring up or protection of property of o thers  that has been damaged as a result of an Occurrence which may be the subject of indemnity under  this Policy.

      "  Insurer  Policy Terms and Conditions for Broadform Liability Policy  Our Agreement with You  This Policy is a legal contract between You and Us. You pay Us the premium, and We provide You with the  cover You have chosen as set out in the Policy, occurring during the Period of Insurance shown on Your P olicy  Schedule or any renewal period.  Words importing persons shall include corporations and other legal entities. The singular includes references  to the plural and vice versa. Headings, wherever appearing in this Policy, have been included for ease of  reference and shall not be used for interpretation purposes.  You (being the insured party named first in the Policy Schedule) having submitted a Proposal containing  particulars for the purpose of obtaining this insurance and having paid or agreed to pay the premium specified  in the Policy Schedule, We agree, subject to the terms, provisions, limitations, exclusions, and conditions  contained in or endorsed on or otherwise expressed in the Policy, to provide insurance in the manner and to  the extent hereinafter provided.  The amount of any Deductible that applies to Your Policy will be shown on Your Policy Schedule.   The exclusions in the section(s) headed ‘When you are not covered’ and conditions in the section headed  ‘General Conditions’ apply to all sections of this Policy.  You must tell Us of the interests of all parties (e.g. financiers, owners, lessors) who will be covered by this  insurance. We will protect their interests only if You have told us about them and We have note d them on  Your Policy Schedule.  Other Party’s Interests  Paying your Premium  You must pay Your premium by the due date. If We do not receive Your premium by this date or Your  payment is dishonoured this Policy will not operate and there will be no cover.   Preventing our Right of Recovery  If You have agreed not to seek compensation from another person who is liable to compensate You for any  loss, damage or liability which is covered by this Policy, We will not cover You under this Policy for that loss,  damage or liability except where we agree otherwise under the Contractual Liability Exclusion (clause 5.4),  including Incidental Contracts (clause 4.11), or under the Subrogation Waiver (clause 6.9) or in writing.   How Goods and Services Tax affects any Payments we make   The amount of premium payable by You for this Policy includes an amount on account of the GST on the  premium.  When We pay a claim, Your GST status will determine the amount We pay. When You are:  •  •  not registered for GST, the amount We pay is the Limit of Liability or the oth er limits of insurance cover  including GST.  registered for GST, We will pay the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance and where You are  liable to pay an amount for GST in respect of an acquisition relevant to Your claim, We will pay for the  GST amount.    We will reduce the GST amount We pay for by the amount of any input tax credits to which You are or would  be entitled if You made a relevant acquisition. In these circumstances, the input tax credit may be claimable  through Your business activity statement (BAS). You must advise Us of Your correct Australian business  number and taxable percentage.

      "  Any GST liability arising from Your incorrect advice is payable by You. Where the settlement of Your claim is  less than the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance cover, We will only pay an amount for GST (less  Your entitlement for input tax credit) applicable to the settlement. This means that if these amounts are not  sufficient to cover Your loss, We will only pay the GST relating to Our settlement of the claim.  We will (where relevant) pay You on Your claim by reference to the GST-exclusive amount of any supply made  by any Business of Yours which is relevant to Your claim.   GST, input tax credit (ITC), business activity statement (BAS) and  acquisition have the same meaning as given  to those expressions in A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 and related legislation as  amended from time to time.  Taxable percentage is Your entitlement to an input tax credit on Your premium as a percentage of the total  GST on that premium.  We will cover You for Your legal liability to pay all sums by way of compensation, and all costs awarded  against You in respect of:  1.  What you are insured against  1.1  Liability  •  Personal Injury  •  Property Damage  •  Advertising Liability    1.2  Additional Payments  If We agree to cover You We will:   happening during the Period of Insurance and caused by an Occurrence within the Territorial Limits in  connection with Your Business or Products.  a)  defend in Your name and on Your behalf any claim or legal action against You seeking damages for  Personal Injury, Property Damage or Advertising Liability even if the action is groundless, false or  fraudulent, and We will investigate, negotiate and settle any claim or legal act ion as We see fit,   b)  pay all legal costs and expenses incurred by Us and all interest accruing after entry of judgement  until We have paid, tendered or deposited in court such part of the judgement as does not exceed  the Limit of Liability,  reimburse You for all reasonable expenses, including loss of salaries and wages incurred by You  with Our consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld in connection with the defence of a  claim or legal action,  c)  d)  pay all legal costs incurred by you with our consent for Your any solicitor, defence counsel or the  equivalent thereof for representation at any inquest, fatal inquiry or other proceedings in  connection with any alleged breach of statutory duty relating to an occurrence which may give rise  to a claim for compensation under this Policy,   e)  pay premiums on:  i.  ii.  bonds to release attachments for amounts not exceeding the applicable Limit of Liability of  this Policy but We shall have no obligation to apply for or furnish any such bond;   appeal bonds and/or security for costs required in any suit but We shall have no obligation to  apply for or furnish any such bonds and/or security for costs;  f)  pay reasonable expenses incurred by You for first aid to others at the time of Personal Injury  caused by an Occurrence (other than medical expenses prohibited by Section 126 of the Health  Insurance Act 1973),  g)  pay all costs incurred by You for temporary repairs, shoring up or protection of property of others  that has been damaged as a result of an Occurrence which may be the subject of inde mnity under  this Policy.

      "                                  Policy Terms and Conditions for Broadform Liability Policy  Insurer  Our Agreement with You  This Policy is a legal contract between You and Us. You pay Us the premium, and We provide You with the  cover You have chosen as set out in the Policy, occurring during the Period of Insurance shown on Your Policy  Schedule or any renewal period.  Words importing persons shall include corporations and other legal entities. The singular includes references  to the plural and vice versa. Headings, wherever appearing in this Policy, have been included for ease of  reference and shall not be used for interpretation purposes.  You (being the insured party named first in the Policy Schedule) having submitted a Proposal containing  particulars for the purpose of obtaining this insurance and having paid or agreed to pay the premium specified  in the Policy Schedule, We agree, subject to the terms, provisions, limitations, exclusions, and conditions  contained in or endorsed on or otherwise expressed in the Policy, to provide insurance in the manner and to  the extent hereinafter provided.  The amount of any Deductible that applies to Your Policy will be shown on Your Policy Schedule.  The exclusions in the section(s) headed ‘When you are not covered’ and conditions in the section headed  ‘General Conditions’ apply to all sections of this Policy.  You must tell Us of the interests of all parties (e.g. financiers, owners, lessors) who will be covered by this  insurance. We will protect their interests only if You have told us about them and We have noted them on  Your Policy Schedule.  Other Party’s Interests  Paying your Premium  You must pay Your premium by the due date. If We do not receive Your premium by this date or Your  payment is dishonoured this Policy will not operate and there will be no cover.  Preventing our Right of Recovery  If You have agreed not to seek compensation from another person who is liable to compensate You for any  loss, damage or liability which is covered by this Policy, We will not cover You under this Policy for that loss,  damage or liability except where we agree otherwise under the Contractual Liability Exclusion (clause 5.4),  including Incidental Contracts (clause 4.11), or under the Subrogation Waiver (clause 6.9) or in writing.  How Goods and Services Tax affects any Payments we make  The amount of premium payable by You for this Policy includes an amount on account of the GST on the  premium.  When We pay a claim, Your GST status will determine the amount We pay. When You are:  •  •  not registered for GST, the amount We pay is the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance cover  including GST.  registered for GST, We will pay the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance and where You are  liable to pay an amount for GST in respect of an acquisition relevant to Your claim, We will pay for the  GST amount.  We will reduce the GST amount We pay for by the amount of any input tax credits to which You are or would  be entitled if You made a relevant acquisition. In these circumstances, the input tax credit may be claimable  through Your business activity statement (BAS). You must advise Us of Your correct Australian business  number and taxable percentage.    IBNA Broadform Liability Insurance Policy.  ©2019 Chubb Insurance Australia Limited.

      "                    Any GST liability arising from Your incorrect advice is payable by You. Where the settlement of Your claim is  less than the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance cover, We will only pay an amount for GST (less  Your entitlement for input tax credit) applicable to the settlement. This means that if these amounts are not  sufficient to cover Your loss, We will only pay the GST relating to Our settlement of the claim.  We will (where relevant) pay You on Your claim by reference to the GST-exclusive amount of any supply made  by any Business of Yours which is relevant to Your claim.  GST, input tax credit (ITC), business activity statement (BAS) and acquisition have the same meaning as given  to those expressions in A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 and related legislation as  amended from time to time.  Taxable percentage is Your entitlement to an input tax credit on Your premium as a percentage of the total  GST on that premium.    We will cover You for Your legal liability to pay all sums by way of compensation, and all costs awarded  against You in respect of:  1.

You pay Us the premium, and We provide You with the  cover You have chosen as set out in the Policy, occurring during the Period of Insurance shown on Your Policy  Schedule or any renewal period.  Words importing persons shall include corporations and other legal entities. The singular includes references  to the plural and vice versa. Headings, wherever appearing in this Policy, have been included for ease of  reference and shall not be used for interpretation purposes.  You (being the insured party named first in the Policy Schedule) having submitted a Proposal containing  particulars for the purpose of obtaining this insurance and having paid or agreed to pay the premium specified  in the Policy Schedule, We agree, subject to the te rms, provisions, limitations, exclusions, and conditions  contained in or endorsed on or otherwise expressed in the Policy, to provide insurance in the manner and to  the extent hereinafter provided.  The amount of any Deductible that applies to Your Policy will be shown on Your Policy Schedule.  The exclusions in the section(s) headed ‘When you are not covered’ and conditions in the section headed  ‘General Conditions’ apply to all sections of this Policy.   You must tell Us of the interests of all parties (e.g. financiers, owners, lessors) who will be covered by this  insurance. We will protect their interests only if You have told us about them and We have noted them on  Your Policy Schedule.  Other Party’s Interests  Paying your Premium  You must pay Your premium by the due date. If We do not receive Your premium by this date or Your  payment is dishonoured this Policy will not operate and there will be no cover.   Preventing our Right of Recovery  If You have agreed not to seek compensation from another person who is liable to compensate You for any  loss, damage or liability which is covered by this Policy, We will not cover You under this Policy for that loss,  damage or liability except where we agree otherwise under the Contractual Liability Exclusion ( clause 5.4),  including Incidental Contracts (clause 4.11), or under the Subrogation Waiver (clause 6.9) or in writing.   How Goods and Services Tax affects any Payments we make   The amount of premium payable by You for this Policy includes an amount on acc ount of the GST on the  premium.  When We pay a claim, Your GST status will determine the amount We pay. When You are:  •  •  not registered for GST, the amount We pay is the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance cover  including GST.  registered for GST, We will pay the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance and where You are  liable to pay an amount for GST in respect of an acquisition relevant to Your claim, We will pay for the  GST amount.  We will reduce the GST amount We pay for by the amount of any input tax credits to which You are or would  be entitled if You made a relevant acquisition. In these circumstances, the input tax credit may be claimable  through Your business activity statement (BAS). You must advise Us of Your correct A ustralian business  number and taxable percentage.    IBNA Broadform Liability Insurance  Policy.  ©2019 Chubb  Insurance  Australia Limited.

      "                    Any GST liability arising from Your incorrect advice is payable by You. Where the settlement of Your claim is  less than the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance cover, We will only pay an amount for GST (less  Your entitlement for input tax credit) applicable to the settlement. This means that if these amounts are not  sufficient to cover Your loss, We will only pay the GST relating to Our settlement of the claim.   We will (where relevant) pay You on Your claim by reference to the GST-exclusive amount of any supply made  by any Business of Yours which is relevant to Your claim.   GST, input tax credit (ITC), business activity statement (BAS) and acquisition have the same meaning as given  to those expressions in A New Tax System (Goods and Services  Tax) Act 1999 and related legislation as  amended from time to time.  Taxable percentage is Your entitlement to an input tax credit on Your premium as a percentage of the total  GST on that premium.

      "  •  •      Policy Terms and Conditions for Broadform Liability Policy  Insurer  Our Agreement with You  This Policy is a legal contract between You and Us. You pay Us the premium, and We provide You with the  cover You have chosen as set out in the Policy, occurring during the Period of Insurance shown on Your Policy  Schedule or any renewal period.  Words importing persons shall include corporations and other legal entities. The singular includes references  to the plural and vice versa. Headings, wherever appearing in this Policy, have been included for ease of  reference and shall not be used for interpretation purposes.  You (being the insured party named first in the Policy Schedule) having submitted a Proposal containing  particulars for the purpose of obtaining this insurance and having paid or agreed to pay the premium specified  in the Policy Schedule, We agree, subject to the terms, provisions, limitations, exclusions, and conditions  contained in or endorsed on or otherwise expressed in the Policy, to provide insurance in the manner and to  the extent hereinafter provided.  The amount of any Deductible that applies to Your Policy will be shown on Your Policy Schedule.   The exclusions in the section(s) headed ‘When you are not covered’ and conditions in the section headed  ‘General Conditions’ apply to all sections of this Policy.   You must tell Us of the interests of all parties (e.g. financiers, owners, lessors) who will be covered by this  insurance. We will protect their interests only if You have told us about them and We have noted them on  Your Policy Schedule.  Other Party’s Interests  Paying your Premium  You must pay Your premium by the due date. If We do not receive Your premium by this date or Your  payment is dishonoured this Policy will not operate and there will be no cover.  Preventing our Right of Recovery  If You have agreed not to seek compensation from another person who is liable to compensate You for any  loss, damage or liability which is covered by this Policy, We will not cover You under this Policy for that loss,  damage or liability except where we agree otherwise under the Contractual Liability Exclusion (clause 5.4),  including Incidental Contracts (clause 4.11), or under the Subrogation Waiver (clause 6.9) or in writing.   How Goods and Services Tax affects any Payments we make   The amount of premium payable by You for this Policy includes an amount on account of the GST on the  premium.  When We pay a claim, Your GST status will determine the amount We pay. When You are:  not registered for GST, the amount We pay is the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance cover  including GST.  registered for GST, We will pay the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance and where You are  liable to pay an amount for GST in respect of an acquisition relevant to Your claim, We will pay for the  GST amount.  We will reduce the GST amount We pay for by the amount of any input tax credits to which You are or would  be entitled if You made a relevant acquisition. In these circumstances, the inpu t tax credit may be claimable  through Your business activity statement (BAS). You must advise Us of Your correct Australian business  number and taxable percentage.

Chubb®,  its logos, and Chubb.Insured.SM  are protected  trademarks of Chubb.    1    Any GST liability arising from Your incorrect advice is payable by You. Where the settlement of Your claim is  less than the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance cover, We will only pay an amount for GST (less  Your entitlement for input tax credit) applicable to the settlement. This means that if these amounts are not  sufficient to cover Your loss, We will only pay the GST relating to Our settlement of the claim.   We will (where relevant) pay You on Your claim by reference to the GST-exclusive amount of any supply made  by any Business of Yours which is relevant to Your claim.   GST, input tax credit (ITC), business activity statement (BAS) and acquisition have the same meaning as given  to those expressions in A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 and related legislation as  amended from time to time.  Taxable percentage is Your entitlement to an input tax credit on Your premium as a percentage of the total  GST on that premium.  We will cover You for Your legal liability to pay all sums by way of compensation, and all costs awarded  against You in respect of:  1.  What you are insured against  1.1  Liability  •  Personal Injury  •  Property Damage  •  Advertising Liability  1.2  Additional Payments  If We agree to cover You We will:   happening during the Period of Insurance and caused by an Occurrence within the Territorial Limits in  connection with Your Business or Products.  a)  defend in Your name and on Your behalf any claim or legal action against You seeking damages for  Personal Injury, Property Damage or Advertising Liability even if the action is groundless, false or  fraudulent, and We will investigate, negotiate and settle any claim or legal action as We see fit,   b)  pay all legal costs and expenses incurred by Us and all interest accruing after entry of judgement  until We have paid, tendered or deposited in court such part of the judgement as does not exceed  the Limit of Liability,  reimburse You for all reasonable expenses, including loss of salaries and wages incurred by You  with Our consent, which shall not be  unreasonably withheld in connection with the defence of a  claim or legal action,  c)  d)  pay all legal costs incurred by you with our consent for Your any solicitor, defence counsel or the  equivalent thereof for representation at any inquest, fatal inquiry or other proceedings in  connection with any alleged breach of statutory duty relating to an occurrence which may give rise  to a claim for compensation under this Policy,   e)  pay premiums on:  i.  ii.  bonds to release attachments for amounts not exceeding the applicable Limit of Liability of  this Policy but We shall have no obligation to apply for or furnish any such bond;   appeal bonds and/or security for costs required in any suit but We shall have no obligation to  apply for or furnish any such bonds and/or security for costs;  f)  pay reasonable expenses incurred by You for first aid to others at the time of Personal Injury  caused by an Occurrence (other than medical expenses prohibited by Section 126 of the Health  Insurance Act 1973),  g)  pay all costs incurred by You for temporary repairs, shoring up or protection of property of o thers  that has been damaged as a result of an Occurrence which may be the subject of indemnity under  this Policy.

      "  Insurer  Policy Terms and Conditions for Broadform Liability Policy  Our Agreement with You  This Policy is a legal contract between You and Us. You pay Us the premium, and We provide You with the  cover You have chosen as set out in the Policy, occurring during the Period of Insurance shown on Your Policy  Schedule or any renewal period.  Words importing persons shall include corporations and other legal entities. The singular includes references  to the plural and vice versa. Headings, wherever appearing in this Policy, have been included for ease of  reference and shall not be used for interpretation purposes.  You (being the insured party named first in the Policy Schedule) havi ng submitted a Proposal containing  particulars for the purpose of obtaining this insurance and having paid or agreed to pay the premium specified  in the Policy Schedule, We agree, subject to the terms, provisions, limitations, exclusions, and conditions  contained in or endorsed on or otherwise expressed in the Policy, to provide insurance in the manner and to  the extent hereinafter provided.  The amount of any Deductible that applies to Your Policy will be shown on Your Policy Schedule.   The exclusions in the section(s) headed ‘When you are not covered’ and conditions in the section headed  ‘General Conditions’ apply to all sections of this Policy.   You must tell Us of the interests of all parties (e.g. financiers, owners , lessors) who will be covered by this  insurance. We will protect their interests only if You have told us about them and We have noted them on  Your Policy Schedule.  Other Party’s Interests  Paying your Premium  You must pay Your premium by the due date. If We do not receive Your p remium by this date or Your  payment is dishonoured this Policy will not operate and there will be no cover.   Preventing our Right of Recovery  If You have agreed not to seek compensation from another person who is liable to compensate You for any  loss, damage or liability which is covered by this Policy, We will not cover You under this Policy for that loss,  damage or liability except where we agree otherwise under the Contractual Liability Exclusion (clause 5.4),  including Incidental Contracts (clause 4.11), or under the Subrogation Waiver (clause 6.9) or in writing.   How Goods and Services Tax affects any Payments we make   The amount of premium payable by You for this Policy includes an amount on account of the GST on the  premium.  When We pay a claim, Your GST status will determine the amount We pay. When You are:  •  •  not registered for GST, the amount We pay is the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance cover  including GST.  registered for GST, We will pay the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance and where You are  liable to pay an amount for GST in respect of an acquisition relevant to Your claim, We will pay for the  GST amount.    We will reduce the GST amount We pay for by the amount of any input tax credits to which You are or would  be entitled if You made a relevant acquisition. In these circumstances, the input tax credit may be claimable  through Your business activity statement (BAS). You must advise Us of Your correct Australian business  number and taxable percentage.

      "  Any GST liability arising from Your incorrect advice is payable by You. Where the settlement of Your claim is  less than the Limit of Liability or the other limits of insurance cover, We will only pay an amount for GST (less  Your entitlement for input tax credit) applicable to the settlement. This means that if these amounts are not  sufficient to cover Your loss, We will only pay the GST relating to Our settlement of the claim.   We will (where relevant) pay You on Your claim by reference to the GST-exclusive amount of any supply made  by any Business of Yours which is relevant to Your claim.   GST, input tax credit (ITC), business activity statement (BAS) and acquisition have the same meaning as given  to those expressions in A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 and  related legislation as  amended from time to time.  Taxable percentage is Your entitlement to an input tax credit on Your premium as a percentage of the total  GST on that premium.  We will cover You for Your legal liability to pay all sums by way of compensation, and all costs awarded  against You in respect of:  1.  What you are insured against  1.1  Liability  •  Personal Injury  •  Property Damage  •  Advertising Liability    1.2  Additional Payments  If We agree to cover You We will:   happening during the Period of Insurance and caused by an Occurrence within the Territorial Limi ts in  connection with Your Business or Products.  a)  defend in Your name and on Your behalf any claim or legal action against You seeking damages for  Personal Injury, Property Damage or Advertising Liability even if the action is groundless, false or  fraudulent, and We will investigate, negotiate and settle any claim or legal action as We see fit,   b)  pay all legal costs and expenses incurred by Us and all interest accruing after entry of judgement  until We have paid, tendered or deposited in court such part of the judgement as does not exceed  the Limit of Liability,  reimburse You for all reasonable expenses, including loss of salaries and wages incurred by You  with Our consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld in connection with the defence of a  claim or legal action,  c)  d)  pay all legal costs incurred by you with our consent for Your any solicitor, defence counsel or the  equivalent thereof for representation at any inquest, fatal inquiry or other proceed ings in  connection with any alleged breach of statutory duty relating to an occurrence which may give rise  to a claim for compensation under this Policy,   e)  pay premiums on:  i.  ii.  bonds to release attachments for amounts not exceeding the applicable Limit of Liabi lity of  this Policy but We shall have no obligation to apply for or furnish any such bond;   appeal bonds and/or security for costs required in any suit but We shall have no obligation to  apply for or furnish any such bonds and/or security for costs;  f)  pay reasonable expenses incurred by You for first aid to others at the time of Personal Injury  caused by an Occurrence (other than medical expenses prohibited by Section 126 of the Health  Insurance Act 1973),  g)  pay all costs incurred by You for temporary repairs, shoring up or protection of property of others  that has been damaged as a result of an Occurrence which may be the subject of indemnity under  this Policy.

(ii)  Where existing insurance applies to the acquired properties, companies, firms, corporations,  entities or other bodies over which the Insured exercises management responsibility, this Policy  will indemnify the Insured for any difference in conditions and limits, until expiry or cessation of  such existing insurance. 6.2  ADJUSTMENT OF PREMIUM Unless otherwise stated the premium for this Policy or any renewal or replacement thereof is a flat  premium and is not subject to adjustment except as provided in Condition 6.4 Cancellation herein. However, where the premium is stated to be adjustable, the Insured will within a reasonable period  after expiry of each Period of Insurance furnish such information as the Insurer may require to adjust  the premium and any difference in premium shall be paid by or allowed to the Insured as the case  may be. 6.3  BANKRUPTCY OR INSOLVENCY In the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Insured or any of the parties or entities comprising  the Insured, the Insurer shall not be relieved of the payment of any claim hereunder because of such  bankruptcy or insolvency. 6.4  CANCELLATION (a)  This Policy may be terminated at any time by the Insured tendering notice in writing to the Insurer.

The Insurer shall be permitted, but not obligated, to inspect the Insured’s property and operations  at any time.  Neither the Insurer’s right to make inspections nor the making thereof nor any report  thereon shall constitute an undertaking on behalf of or for the benefit of the Insured or others to  determine or warrant that such property or operations are safe.  The Insurer may examine and audit  the Insured’s books and records at any time during the Period of Insurance and extensions thereof  and within three years after the final termination of this Policy, as far as they relate to the subject  matter of this insurance. 6.9  INSURED’S DUTIES (a)  In the event of an Occurrence the Insured shall promptly take at its own expense all reasonable  steps to prevent Personal Injury or Property Damage or Advertising Liability arising or continuing  out of such Occurrence. (b)  The Insured shall give notice in writing to the Insurer as soon reasonably practicable of every  Occurrence, and shall forward to the Insurer all information relevant to such Occurrences that  the Insurer may reasonably require, in particular every demand, writ, summons, proceeding,  impending prosecution, inquest. (c)  The Insured shall not without the Insurer’s consent, make any admission, offer, promise or  payment in connection with any Occurrence. (d)  The Insured shall use its best endeavours to preserve all property, products, appliances, plant and all  other things which may assist in the investigation or defence of a claim or in the exercise of rights  of subrogation and so far as may be reasonably practicable no alteration or repair shall be effected  without the consent of the Insurer until the Insurer shall have had an opportunity of inspection. 6.10  NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE The indemnity provided by this Policy shall not be prejudiced by any change in the name of the Insured  in accordance with an application under legislation permitting the change in the name of the Insured.

      "6.11  POLICY INTERPRETATIONS Where words other than the Insured or the Insurer have been used in this Policy to represent those  legal entities, it is agreed that for the purposes of this Policy and any subsequent endorsements,  the words the Insured and the Insurer are deemed to have the same meaning as those alternative  words used in this Policy. It is further agreed that: (a)  words importing persons shall include corporations and other legal entities; (b)  references in the singular shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa;  (c)  words depicting any gender include reference to all other genders; (d)  references to money shall be expressed as Australian dollars, unless otherwise stated. 6.12  PROPER LAW Any dispute arising under this contract of insurance or concerning its formation shall be determined  in accordance with the law of the Commonwealth of Australia and the States and Territories thereof,  and any disputes relating thereto shall be submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of such State   and Territory. 6.13  SEVERABILITY AND CROSS LIABILITY This Policy, including any amendment, renewal or variation or endorsement to or of it, shall be  construed as if each person, corporation, entity or other organisation entitled to claim on it, whether  a party to the contract of insurance or not, had made a proposal, application or request for the Policy,  or amendment, or renewal, or variation or endorsement, in respect of their interest only.  Further any  information or knowledge possessed by a person, corporation, entity or other organisation entitled  to claim on this Policy, whether possessed before or after the contract was entered into, shall not be  imputed to any other person, corporation, entity or other organisation. The Insurer will not seek any relief whatsoever (including cancellation of the Policy) for non-disclosure  or misrepresentation or both against a person, corporation, entity or other organisation entitled  to claim under this Policy unless the Insurer would have been entitled to that relief had the person  claiming been the only person covered by the Policy. Further neither the inclusion of more than one Insured under this Policy nor any act, omission, breach  or default by an Insured shall in any way affect the rights of any other Insured, it being intended that  this Policy should be construed as if a separate contract of insurance had been entered into by each  Insured; but not so as to increase the Insurer’s Limit of Liability under this Policy. 6.14  STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS The Insured shall take reasonable measures to comply with all statutory obligations and regulations  imposed by any statutory or governmental authority. 6.15  SUBROGATION In the event of payment for loss under this Policy to or on behalf of the Insured, the Insurer shall be  subrogated to all the Insured’s rights of recovery against all persons and organisations. Notwithstanding this, the Insurer agrees to waive all right of subrogation under this Policy against  any corporation or corporations, the majority of whose capital stock is owned or controlled by the  Insured, or against any party, corporation, firm or individual, to which or to whom protection is  afforded under this Policy subject to the Insured waiving those rights of subrogation under contract  or agreement prior to the loss occurring.  The Insurer further agrees that an Insured’s right to indemnity under this Policy will not be prejudiced  by the Insured agreeing to exclude or limit the liability of such parties under contract prior to the loss  occurring.  14  \n",

The Insurer’s  costs shall include all amounts expended in the investigation, settlement or defence of any claims for  Compensation (even if such claim is groundless, false or fraudulent) including actual loss of earnings and  in relation to any appeal, coroner’s inquest, royal commission or other enquiry in respect of which the  Insured is entitled to indemnity under this Policy or if sustained would be so entitled; (b)  all premiums on appeal bonds and security for costs required in any such suit and pay premiums on  bonds to release attachments in any suit for an amount not in excess of the applicable Limit of Liability  of this Policy, but the Insurer shall have no obligation to apply for or furnish any such bonds or security  for costs; (c)  all interest accruing after entry of judgement until the Insurer has paid, tendered or deposited in court  such part of such judgement as does not exceed the Limit of Liability; (d)  all legal costs incurred by the Insured with the consent of the Insurer arising out of the defence of any  proceedings in any court arising out of any alleged breach of statutory duty resulting in a claim which  may be the subject of indemnity under this Policy. (e)  expenses incurred by the Insured for temporary protection (which includes purchasing, hiring, erecting or  dismantling hoarding, barriers, fences and any other form of temporary protection whether provided in  compliance with any statutory requirement or not) of damaged or undamaged property of any person or  entity, including temporary repairs, shoring up and underpinning of such property. 4  \n",

Provided however, that failure to give notice of any Occurrence which, at the time of its happening did  not appear to involve this Policy, but which at a later date would appear to give rise to a claim or claims  hereunder, shall not prejudice such claim or claims. 6.

(c)  Whenever the Insured has information from which they may reasonably conclude that an  Occurrence covered under this Policy has happened and is likely to involve this Policy, notice shall  be given by or on behalf of the Insured to the Insurer or any of its authorised agents as soon as  practicable. Provided that failure to give notice of any Occurrence which at the time of its happening did not  appear to involve this Policy, but which at a later date would appear to give rise to a Claim or  Claims hereunder, shall not prejudice such Claim or Claims. (d)  The Insured shall not, without the Insurer’s consent, make any admission, offer, promise or  payment in connection with any Occurrence. (e)  The Insured shall use its best endeavours to preserve all property, products, appliances, plant and  all other things which may assist in the investigation or defence of a Claim or in the exercise of  rights of subrogation and so far as may be reasonably practicable no alteration or repair shall  be effected without the consent of the Insurer until the Insurer shall have had an opportunity of  inspection. 6.11  Maintenance of Underlying Insurance The underlying policies listed in the Schedule of Underlying Insurance and renewals or replacement  thereof, not being more restrictive in coverage, shall be maintained in force as valid collectible  insurance during the currency of this Policy, except for any reduction of the aggregate limits  contained therein solely by reason of Claims. In the event of failure by the Insured to maintain  such policies or to meet all conditions, the insurance afforded by this Policy shall apply in the same  manner as if such policies had been maintained in force.

      "6.12  Master Policy Clause The Insurer, or others on behalf of the Insured, may issue local primary policies for the purpose of  local legal requirements, servicing, premium payment and claims handling. Accordingly, should any local policy by virtue of its scope of cover, definitions, conditions or limits  of liability not indemnify the Insured in whole or in part in respect of Compensation and Additional  Payments as herein defined, this Umbrella Liability Policy, subject to its terms and Conditions, shall  provide indemnity to the extent that such indemnity is not provided by the local policy but which  would have been provided had such local policy followed the terms and Conditions of this Master  Policy. Provided that : (a)  the Limit of Liability under this Master Policy shall be reduced by an amount equal to the  indemnity recoverable under any local policy; (b)  notwithstanding the number of separate Insureds under all local policies, the aggregate liability  of the Insurer under this Policy to the Insureds jointly and severally shall not exceed the amount  stated in the Placing Schedule of this Policy; (c)  such local policies are listed in the Schedule of Underlying Insurance. 6.13  Notiﬁcation of Change The indemnity provided by this Policy shall not be prejudiced by any change in the name of the  Insured in accordance with an application under legislation permitting the change in the name of  the Insured. 6.14  Payment of Ultimate Net Loss Coverage under this Policy shall not apply unless and until the Insured, and/or the Insured’s  underlying insurer(s), shall be obligated to pay or agree to pay the amount of the underlying limit  and/or Self Insured Retention.  When the amount of Ultimate Net Loss has finally been determined  and rendered certain either by final judgement against the Insured after actual trial or by written  agreement of the Insured, the claimant and the Insurer, the Insurer shall promptly pay on behalf of  the Insured the amount of Ultimate Net Loss falling within the terms of this Policy, or at the request  of the Insured, pay on behalf of the Insured, that part of the Ultimate Net Loss which is in excess of  the Self Insured Retention 6.15  Policy Interpretations Where words other than the Insured or the Insurer have been used in this Policy document to  represent those legal entities, it is agreed that for the purposes of this Policy and any subsequent  Endorsements, the words the Insured and the Insurer are deemed to have the same meaning as  those alternative words used in this Policy. It is further agreed that: (a)  words importing persons shall include corporations and other legal entities (b)  references in the singular shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa; (c)  words depicting any gender include reference to all other genders; (d)  references to money shall be expressed as Australian dollars, unless otherwise stated. 20  \n",

      "6.16  Premium Unless otherwise stated the Premium for this Policy or any renewal or replacement thereof is a flat  premium and is not subject to adjustment except as provided in Condition 6.6 Cancellation herein. However, where the Premium is stated to be adjustable, the Insured shall within a reasonable period  after the expiry of each Period of Insurance furnish such information as the Insurer may require to  adjust the Premium, and any difference in Premium shall be paid by or allowed to the Insured as the  case may be. In the event of additional Insureds’ being added to the coverage on any Underlying Insurances  during the currency of this Policy, notice shall be given to the Insurer and, if an additional premium  has been charged for such addition on the Underlying Insurances, the Insurer shall be entitled to  charge an appropriate additional premium if required. 6.17  Proper Law Any dispute arising under this contract of insurance or concerning its formation shall be determined  in accordance with the law of the Commonwealth of Australia and the States and Territories thereof,  and any disputes relating thereto shall be submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of such State  and Territory. 6.18  Review of Underlying Insurance By the signing of this Policy the Insurer declares that they have reviewed the extent of coverage  provided by any of the policies listed in the Schedule of Underlying Insurance from information  disclosed in any quotation slip, completed application or proposal for umbrella liability insurance  and/ or to a specific enquiry prior to inception of this Policy. The Insurer acknowledges that they understand the effect of any sub-limit(s), variations or limitations  of or restrictions to coverage afforded by any of the policies listed in the Schedule of Underlying  Insurance as far as such affects the terms, Conditions and coverage herein provided. 6.19  Severability and Cross Liability This Policy, including any amendment, renewal or variation or Endorsement to or of it, shall be  construed as if each person, corporation, entity or other organisation entitled to claim on it,  whether a party to the contract of insurance or not, had made a proposal, application or request  for the Policy, or amendment, or renewal, or variation or Endorsement, in respect of their interest  only.  Further any information or knowledge possessed by a person, corporation, entity or other  organisation entitled to claim on this Policy, whether possessed before or after the contract was  entered into, shall not be imputed to any other person, corporation, entity or other organisation. The Insurer will not seek any relief whatsoever (including cancellation of the Policy) for non- disclosure and/or misrepresentation against a person, corporation, entity or other organisation  entitled to claim under this Policy unless the Insurer would have been entitled to that relief had the  person claiming been the only person covered by the Policy. Further neither the inclusion of more than one Insured under this Policy nor any act, omission,  breach or default by an Insured shall in any way affect the rights of any other Insured, it being  intended that this Policy should be construed as if a separate contract of insurance had been entered  into by each Insured; but not so as to increase the Insurer’s Limit of Liability under this Policy.

      "6.20  Subrogation Subject to any restrictions imposed by the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) the Insurer shall be  subrogated to all the Insured’s rights of recovery against any person or organisation and the Insured  shall execute and deliver instruments and papers and do all such acts and things necessary to secure  such rights. Notwithstanding this, the Insurer agrees to waive all right of subrogation under this Policy against  any corporation or corporations, the majority of whose capital stock is owned or controlled by the  Insured, or against any party, corporation, firm or individual, to which or to whom protection is  afforded under this Policy subject to the Insured waiving those rights of subrogation under contract  or agreement prior to the loss occurring.  The Insurer further agrees that an Insured’s right to indemnity under this Policy will not be prejudiced  by the Insured agreeing to exclude or limit the liability of such parties under contract prior to the loss  occurring.  All salvages, recoveries or payments recovered or received subsequent to a loss settlement under  this Policy shall be applied as if recovered or received prior to such settlement and all necessary  adjustments shall then be made between the Insured and the Insurer, provided always that nothing  in this Condition 6.20 shall be construed to mean that losses under this Policy are not recoverable  until the Insured’s Ultimate Net Loss has been fully ascertained. To the extent that this Policy provides coverage in excess of the policies listed in the Schedule of  Underlying Insurances, the Insured’s rights of recovery against any person or entity cannot always  be exclusively subrogated to the Insurer. It is therefore understood and agreed that, in respect of  any payment hereunder, the Insurer will act in concert with all other parties (including the Insured)  concerned, in the exercise of such rights of recovery. The apportioning of any amounts which may  be so recovered shall follow the principle that any interests (including the Insured) that shall have  paid an amount over and above any payment under this Policy, shall first be reimbursed up to the  amount paid by them; the Insurer shall then be reimbursed out of any balance then remaining  up to the amount paid hereunder; lastly, the interests (including the Insured) of whom this Policy  is in excess are entitled to claim any residue, if any. All expense necessary to the recovery of such  amounts shall be apportioned between the interests (including the Insured) concerned, in the ratio  of their respective recoveries as finally settled. 22  \n",

Statutory  Liability Endorsement  1.  Notice to the Insured   This Endorsement provides cover on a claims made and notified basis .  A Statutory  Liability Claim must be made against the Insured during the Period of Insurance  and the Insured must notify the Insurer in writing of such Statutory  Liability Claim during the  Period of Insurance.  The Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) provides that where an insured gives notice in writing to the  insurer of facts that might give rise to a claim against the insured as soon as reasonably practicable  after the insured became aware of those facts the insurer is not relieved of liability under the policy in  respect of the claim, when made, solely by reason that the claim is made after expiry of the policy. This  is a right which arises solely under the Act and not under the  insurance contract. The right does not  arise unless the notice in writing is given before the policy expires.   2.  Statutory  Liability Insuring Clause  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Endorsement,  the Insurer will pay to or on behalf of the  Insured any Statutory Liability Loss arising from any Statutory Liability Claim first made  against the Insured and notified to the Insurer during the Period of Insurance arising out of the  Insured’s Business.   3.  Statutory  Liability Limit of Liability and Deductible  The Insurer’s liability under this Endorsement in respect of all Statutory Liability Losses arising  out of all Statutory  Liability Claims covered by this Endorsement during the Period of  Insurance shall not exceed the corresponding Sub Limit set  out in the Schedule.  All Statutory  Liability Losses arising out of any one Wrongful Breach, interrelated Wrongful  Breaches or series of related Wrongful Breaches are deemed to be one Statutory Liability  Loss.  The Insurer’s liability under this Endorsement applies only to that part of each Statutory Liability  Loss in excess of the Deductible.  4.  Statutory  Liability Defence  Costs  The Insurer agrees to pay any Statutory  Liability Defence  Costs, incurred with the prior written  consent of the Insurer, in connection with any Statutory Liability Claim, for which indemnity is  available under this Endorsement, provided that Statutory Liability Defence  Costs are within the  corresponding Sub Limit set out in the Schedule.  The Insurer will not be obliged to provide such consent, unless the Insurer is satisfied that the  Insured has Reasonable Grounds for Defence.  Where proceedings are commenced to impose a Statutory Penalty and those proceedings are also in  respect of other matters, then the Insurer will not be liable for the proportion of the legal costs and  associated expenses that may be reasonably attributed to the proceedings in relation to those other  matters.       \n",

The Insurer shall not be liable for any payment of any Statutory Penalty without its  consent, and such consent will not be unreasonably withheld by the Insurer.  10.4  The Insurer shall be entitled, but not obligated, to take over conduct in the name of the  Insured of the investigation, defence and settlement of any Statutory Liability Claim.

The Insured must,  at its own cost, provide all reasonable assistance to the Insurer (including, but not limited to  giving information, signing documents and giving evidence) to help enforce those rights.   The Insured must not do anything that may prejudice the Insurer’s position or its potential  or actual rights of recovery against any party. Any amounts recovered by the Insurer shall be  allocated in accordance with s.67 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth).   10.6  Where the Insurer recommends to the Insured to pay any Statutory Penalty, consent to  any order directing the Insured to pay Statutory  Liability Claim or otherwise settle or  resolve any Statutory Liability Claim and the Insured does not agree to do so, then the  Insurer is entitled to reduce its liability to the Insured to the extent of any prejudice suffered  by the Insurer by reason of the Insured’s failure to so agree.  10.7  If the Insured continues to defend a Statutory Liability Claim where the Insurer has  refused to provide consent and the Insured is successful in respect of that claim, then consent  shall be deemed to have been given at the time it was first requested by the Insured.

      "    Statutory Liability Endorsement  Preamble  In consideration of the payment of the premium by the Insured to Chubb Insurance Australia Limited  (Chubb), and in reliance upon the declarations made within the broker’s submission, and subject to all terms,  conditions, exclusions and limitations of this Policy and this Endorsement, Chubb agrees to indemnify the  Insured in accordance with the following:  1.  Notice to the Insured   This Endorsement provides cover on a claims made and notified basis .  A Statutory  Liability Claim must be made against the Insured during the Policy Period and the  Insured must notify Chubb in writing of such Statutory  Liability Claim during the Policy Period.  The Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) provides that where an insured gives notice in writing to the insurer  of facts that might give rise to a claim against the insured as soon as reasonably practicable after the insured  became aware of those facts the insurer is not relieved of liability under the policy in respect of the claim,  when made, solely by reason that the claim is made after expiry of the policy. This is a right which arises solely  under the Act and not under the insurance contract. The right does not arise unless the notice in writing is  given before the policy expires.  2.  Insuring Clause  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Endorsement,  Chubb will pay to or on behalf of the Insured any  Statutory  Liability Loss arising from any Statutory  Liability Claim first made against the Insured and  notified to Chubb during the Policy Period arising out of the Business.   3.  Limit of Liability and Deductible  Chubb’s liability under this Endorsement in respect of all Statutory Liability Losses arising out of all  Statutory  Liability Claims covered by this Endorsement during the Policy Period shall not exceed the  corresponding Sub Limit set out in the Schedule.  All Statutory  Liability Losses arising out of any one Wrongful Breach, interrelated Wrongful  Breaches or series of related Wrongful Breaches are deemed to be one Statutory Liability Loss.  Chubb’s liability under this Endorsement applies only to that part of each Statutory Liability Loss in  excess of the Deductible.  4.  Defence Costs  Chubb agrees to pay any Statutory  Liability Defence  Costs, incurred with the prior written consent of  Chubb, in connection with any Statutory Liability Claim, for which indemnity is available under this  Endorsement, provided that Statutory Liability Defence  Costs are within the corresponding Sub Limit  set out in the Schedule.  Chubb will not be obliged to provide such consent, unless Chubb is satisfied that the Insured has  Reasonable  Grounds for Defence.  Where proceedings are commenced to impose a Statutory Penalty and those proceedings are also in respect  of other matters, then Chubb  will not be liable for the proportion of the legal costs and associated expenses  that may be reasonably attributed to the proceedings in relation to those other matters.  5.  Advancement of Defence Costs  Subject to corresponding Sub Limit set out in the Schedule and the applicable Deductible set out in the  Schedule, Chubb, at its sole discretion, may advance necessarily incurred Statutory Liability Defence  Costs on behalf of the Insured \n",

Conditions  10.1    Chubb has the discretion to apply either the terms and conditions of the statutory liability insurance   Endorsement on risk when the Insured first became aware of the facts and circumstances, including  the limit of liability and deductible, or the terms and conditions of that insurance policy; a nd   Chubb will reduce its liability to the extent of any prejudice suffered as a result of the Insured’s  failure to notify Chubb of such facts or circumstances giving rise to a Statutory  Liability Claim prior  to the Policy Period.  In the event of a Statutory Liability Claim, the Insured must give immediate notice in writing to  Chubb of such claim and such information as Chubb may require to reasonably investigate the  Statutory  Liability Claim and to enable Chubb to determine its liability under this Endorsement,  if any.  10.2   The Insured must take all reasonable care and do and concur to do all things reasonably practicable  to avoid or prevent a Wrongful Breach and/or diminish a Statutory Liability Loss.  10.3   The Insured shall not make any admission, offer, promise or payment in respect of any Statutory  Liability Claim, or agree to pay any Statutory Penalty,  or consent to any order directing the  Insured to pay any Statutory  Penalty without the prior written consent of Chubb.  Chubb shall not be liable for any payment of any Statutory Penalty without its consent, and such  consent will not be unreasonably withheld by Chubb.  10.4  Chubb shall be entitled, but not obligated, to take over conduct in the name of the Insured of the  investigation, defence and settlement of any Statutory Liability Claim. Any amount incurred by  Chubb shall be deemed part of Statutory Liability Defence  Costs.  10.5  If Chubb grants indemnity under this Endorsement in respect of any Statutory  Liability Claim,  then Chubb shall be subrogated to all the Insured’s rights of recovery in respect of such claim,  whether or not payment has in fact been made and whether or not the  Insured has been  compensated in full for its Statutory  Liability Loss. The Insured must, at its own cost, provide all  reasonable assistance to Chubb (including, but not limited to giving information, signing documents  and giving evidence) to help enforce those rights.   The Insured must not do anything that may prejudice Chubb’s position or its potential or actual  rights of recovery against any party. Any amounts recovered by Chubb shall be allocated in  accordance with s.67 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth).  10.6  Where Chubb recommends to the Insured to pay any Statutory  Penalty, consent to any order  directing the Insured to pay Statutory  Liability Claim or otherwise settle or resolve any  Statutory  Liability Claim and the Insured does not agree to do so, then Chubb is entitled to  reduce its liability to the Insured to the extent of any prejudice suffered by Chubb by reason of the  Insured’s failure to so agree.  10.7  If the Insured continues to defend a Statutory Liability Claim where Chubb has refused to  provide consent and the Insured is successful in respect of that claim, then consent shall be deemed  to have been given at the time it was first requested by the Insured. For the purpose of this condition,  “successful” means that the outcome of the Statutory Liability Claim established that at the time at  which Chubb refused consent, the Insured had Reasonable Grounds for Defence.  10.8  The Insured shall comply with any lawful notice or direction received from, or any enforcement  action taken by, any appropriate Regulatory Authority under any Statute within the time specified  or, if no time is specified, within a reasonable time.  10.9  Except to the extent that the Insured is compelled by law to do so, the Insured shall not release to  any third party or otherwise publish details of:   a)  b)  c)  the nature of the liabilities Insured by this Endorsement;  the extent of cover provided by this Endorsement; or   the amount of the Limits of Liability or Sub Limits specified in the Schedule,   \n",

Any  amount recovered shall be apportioned in the following order: 4.2.1  firstly to any interests, including the Insured’s, that have paid an amount over and above any payment under this Policy; 4.2.2  secondly to the Insurers of this Policy; 4.2.3  thirdly to the interests, including the Insured’s, of whom this coverage operates in excess; Expenses for the recovery of such amounts shall be apportioned between the interests, including the Insured’s, in the ratio of their  respective recoveries. 4.3  Assistance and Co-operation Insurers shall have the right and opportunity to associate with the Insured or the Insured’s underlying insurers or both in the  defence and control of any claim, suit or proceeding relative to an Occurrence or claim, which involves or appears reasonable  likely to involve the Insurers in which event the Insured and Insurers shall co-operate in all things in the defence of such claim,  suit or proceeding. 4.4  Cancellation This Policy may be cancelled at any time at the request of the Insured in which case the Insurer shall retain Premium  commensurate with the risk attaching for the period the Policy was in force. The Insurer may only cancel this Policy in accordance with the provisions of the Primary Insurance.   4.5  Defence Costs & Supplementary Payments In the event of a loss arising from a claim to which the Insurers may be liable to contribute, no defence costs and/or  supplementary payments shall be incurred on their behalf without the Insurer’s consent being first obtained. Upon the Insurer  giving such consent, the Insurer shall contribute to such costs in the proportion that their share of the final settled loss bears to  the total sum payable. If however, resolution of the claim, for a sum not exceeding the Underlying Limits occurs, no defence costs  and/or supplementary payments shall be payable by the Insurers.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary where defence costs and/or supplementary payments provided   by the Underlying Insurance are included within the limit of liability then the Limits of Liability of this Policy will also include  such costs and expenses 4.6  Exhaustion of Underlying Aggregate Limit In the event of the exhaustion of any aggregate limit whether partial or total of the Underlying Insurance by reason of a loss paid  thereunder this Policy shall: 4.6.1  in the event of partial exhaustion, pay in excess of the reduced Underlying Insurance; 4.6.2  in the event of total exhaustion, continue in force as the Underlying Insurance subject to the terms conditions  exclusions and endorsements of the Primary Insurance and any endorsements to this Policy. 4.7  Following Cover of Primary Insurance  This Policy is subject to the same terms, definitions, conditions and exclusions (except as regards the Limits of Liability, the  Premium, any agreement to renew or as specifically provided for herein) as are contained in or as may be added to the Primary  Insurance prior to the happening of any circumstance in respect of which a claim is made hereunder. The liability of the Insurers to pay Compensation under this Policy as a result of each Occurrence happening in connection with  the Business shall not exceed the Limits of Liability stated in the Schedule. If an amount is specified in the Schedule against Products in the Limit of Liability, the total liability of the Insurers for all claims  arising out of Products shall not exceed such amount in the aggregate for each Period of Insurance. 5  \n",

      "4.8  Insolvency or Bankruptcy The insolvency or bankruptcy of any party comprising the Insured or the insolvency or bankruptcy or inability to pay of any of the  insurers of the Underlying Insurance shall not release the Insurer from any of its obligations hereunder. Under no circumstances  shall this Policy drop down in the case of insolvency, bankruptcy or inability to pay of an underlying insurer. 4.9  Maintenance of Primary and Underlying Excess Insurance The Primary Insurance and any Underlying Excess Insurance (if applicable) shall be maintained in full effect during the currency  of this Policy except for any reduction of the aggregate limits contained therein by payment of any claims. The failure of the  Insured to comply with the foregoing shall not invalidate this Policy, but in the event of such failure, the Insurers shall only be  liable to the same extent as if the Insured had complied with this Condition. 4.10  Notification of Occurrence and proof of claim Whenever the Insured has information from which the Insured may reasonably conclude that an Occurrence covered hereunder  involved injuries or damages which, in the event that the Insured should be held liable, is likely to involve this Policy, notice shall be sent  to the Insurer as soon as practicable, however, failure to notify the Insurer of any Occurrence which at the time of its happening did not  appear to involve this Policy, but which at a later date would appear to give rise to claims hereunder, shall not prejudice such claims. As soon as practicable after providing such notice, the Insured shall: 4.10.1  advise of the cause and the (estimated) amount of loss and any other proof or information with respect to the claim that  may be reasonably required; 4.10.2  furnish to the Insurer details of any other insurance covering or which may cover the same loss; 4.10.3  at all reasonable times permit the Insurer or its agents to inquire into, investigate and examine the circumstances of any loss. 4.11  Notices and Service of Legal Process The Insured may effect notice, advice or service of any legal process in connection with this Policy upon the Insurer by delivering that  notice, advice or process by hand, by email or similar electronic form or by post to the address of the Insurer stated in the Schedule. 4.12  Proper Law 4.13  Settlement of Losses The Insurer and the Insured hereby submit to the jurisdiction of all Australian Courts in relation to all matters arising under this Policy. The Insured agrees not to settle a loss for a sum in excess of the Underlying Limits without the consent of the Insurers. This Policy shall not cover any expenses or costs that are recoverable under the Underlying Insurance. 4.14   Goods and Services Tax (GST) GST, Input Tax Credit, Acquisition and Supply have the same meaning as given to those expressions in A New Tax System (Goods  and Services Tax) Act 1999 and related legislation as amended from time to time. Taxable Percentage is the Insured’s entitlement to an Input Tax Credit on the Premium as a percentage of the total GST on that  Premium. 4.14.1  Where the Insurer makes a payment under this Policy for the Acquisition of goods, services or other Supply, the amount  of the payment will be reduced by the amount of any Input Tax Credit that the Insured is, or will be, entitled to in  relation to that Acquisition, whether or not the Insured makes that Acquisition. 4.14.2  Where the Insurer makes a payment under this Policy as compensation instead of payment for the Acquisition of goods,  services or other Supply, the Insurer will reduce the amount of the payment by the amount of any Input Tax Credit that  the Insured would have been entitled to had the payment been applied to acquire such goods, services or other Supply. Any GST amount paid by the Insurer shall be in addition to the Limit(s) of Liability specified in the Schedule. No payment shall be made to the Insured for any GST liability that they may acquire upon settlement of a claim if the Insured has  not informed the Insurer of its correct Taxable Percentage. 6  \n",

      "                            7.4  Cancellation  This Policy may be cancelled at any time at the request of the Insured.  The Insurer may also cancel this Policy on any grounds subject to the Insurance Contracts Act 1984  where  the  Insurer  has  given  the  Insured  written  notice  of  such  cancellation  in  accordance  with  the  Act.  The Insurer’s notice of cancellation takes effect at the earlier of the following times:  7.4.1  7.4.2  the  time  when  another  policy  of  insurance  between  the  Insured  and  the  Insurer  or  some  other insurer, being a policy that is intended by the Insured to replace this Policy, is entered  into; or    4.00  PM  on  the  sixtieth  (60)  business  day  after  the  day  on  which  notice  was  given  to  the  Insured.  In the event that either the Insured or the Insurer cancels this Policy, the Insurer will provide a pro- rata refund of Premium for the unexpired Period of Insurance.    7.5  Cross Liability and Severability   This Policy, including any amendment, renewal or variation or endorsement of it, shall be construed as  if each insured party had made a proposal, application or request for the Policy, amendment, renewal,  variation  or  endorsement  in  respect  of  their  interest  only.  Further,  any  information  or  knowledge  possessed by one insured party, whether possessed before or after the contract was entered into, shall  not  be  imputed  to  any  other  such  party.  The  Insurer  will  not  seek  any  relief  whatsoever  (including  cancellation of the Policy) for non-disclosure and/or misrepresentation against an insured party unless  the Insurer would have been entitled to that relief had  that party been the only party covered by this  Policy.  Further,  neither  the  inclusion  of  more  than  one  Insured  under  this  Policy  nor  any  act,  omission,  breach  or  default  by  any  Insured  shall  in  any  way  affect  the  rights  of  any  other  Insured,  it  being  intended  that  this  Policy  shall  be construed as if a separate contract of insurance has been entered  into by each Insured; but not so as to increase the Insurer’s Limit of Liability.  7.6  Goods and Services Tax (GST)    GST, Input Tax Credit, Acquisition and Supply have the same meaning as given to those expressions  in  A  New  Tax  System  (Goods  and  Services  Tax)  Act  1999  and  related  legislation  as  amended  from  time to time.  Taxable  Percentage  is  the  Insured's  entitlement  to  an  Input  Tax  Credit  on  the  Premium  as  a  percentage of the total GST on that Premium.  7.6.1  Where the Insurer makes a payment under this Policy for the Acquisition of goods, services  or other Supply, the amount of the payment will be reduced by the amount of any Input Tax  Credit that the Insured is, or will be, entitled to in relation to that Acquisition, whether or not  the Insured makes that Acquisition.    7.6.2  Where the Insurer makes a payment under this Policy as compensation instead of payment  for the Acquisition of goods, services or other Supply, the Insurer will reduce the amount of  the payment by the amount of any Input Tax Credit that the Insured would have been entitled  to had the payment been applied to acquire such goods, services or other Supply.  Any GST amount paid by the Insurer shall be in addition to the Limit of Liability and/or Sub-Limit of  Liability specified in the Schedule.  No payment shall be made to the Insured for any GST liability that they may acquire upon settlement  of a claim if the Insured has not informed the Insurer of its correct Taxable Percentage.

The Insurer agrees to waive its rights of subrogation under the Policy against:  7.9.1  7.9.2  each  Insured  provided  that  with  respect  to  any  person  who  is  an  Insured  by  reason  of  Definition 4.11.5 or 4.11.6, such waiver of subrogation shall only apply to claims which arise  by reason of Definition 4.11.5 or 4.11.6;    every  company,  organisation  or  person  which  or  who  owns  or  controls  the  majority  of  the  capital  stock  of  any  company  or  organisation  that  is  an  Insured.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  this  Condition  7.11,  this  insurance  will  not  be  prejudiced  by  any  inadvertent delay, error or omission in notifying the Insurer of any Occurrence that may give rise to a  claim or claims under the Policy.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, where Defence Costs and Supplementary Payments  provided by the Specified Underlying Insurance are part of, and not in addition to the limit of liability provided by the  Specified Underlying Insurance, then Defence Costs and Supplementary Payments payable under this Policy will  also be part of the Limit of Liability.  If a payment exceeding the Limit of Liability has to be made to dispose of a Claim or legal action, the Insurer’s liability  to pay any costs, expenses and interest under 1.2 Defence Costs and Supplementary Payments will be limited to  the proportion of those costs, expenses and interest as the Limit of Liability bears to the amount paid to dispose of  the Claim. Any amount that the Insurer pays, other than payments in settlement of Claims, suits and all costs awarded  against the Insured, are payable over and above the Limit of Liability stated in the Schedule. 2.  Limit of Liability  2.1  2.2  2.3  The Insurer’s liability under Insuring Clause 1.1 (Coverage) shall not exceed the Limit of Liability specified in the Schedule as the  result of any one Occurrence.  The Insurer’s liability under Insuring Clause 1.1 (Coverage) arising out of the Insured’s Product shall not exceed the Limit of  Liability specified in the Schedule in the aggregate for all Occurrences during the Period of Insurance. In the event that the aggregate limits of liability of the Specified Underlying Insurance are reduced or exhausted for any  reason, this Policy will continue in excess of the reduced underlying insurance or, in the event of exhaustion continue in force as  underlying insurance for the remainder of the Period of Insurance. For the sake of clarity, Insurers acknowledge if any of the Specified Underlying Insurances are non concurrent with the Period  of Insurance of this Policy and are exhausted or reduced as the result of an Occurrence or Occurrences taking place prior to the  inception date of this Policy and during the policy period of such Specified Underlying Insurances coverage as is afforded by this  Policy shall apply in excess of the reduced underlying policy limit, or if such limit is exhausted, shall apply as underlying insurance.  3.

In case of any payment hereunder, the Insurer shall  act in concert with all other interests including the Insured in exercising such rights of recovery. Any amount recovered shall be  apportioned in the following order: Firstly any interests, including the Insured’s, that have paid an amount over and above any payment under this Policy; Secondly, the Insurer to the extent of its actual payment under this Policy; Thirdly the interests, including the Insured’s of whom this coverage is in excess. Expenses for the recovery of such amounts shall be apportioned between the interests, including the Insured’s, in the ratio of their  respective recoveries. Should the parties be unable to agree on an appropriate apportionment then such expenses shall be paid by  each party in the same proportion as their percentage share of all amounts recovered. If there is no such recovery by the Insurer,  the expenses shall be borne by the Insurer. 6.8  Prior Insurance and Non Accumulation of Liability  It is agreed that if any loss is also covered in whole or in part under any other excess policy issued to the Insured prior to the  inception date hereof, the Limit of Liability as stated in the Schedule shall be reduced by any amounts due to the Insured on  account of any such loss under such prior insurance. 6.9  Maintenance of Underlying Insurance The Specified Underlying Insurance shall be maintained by the Insured in full effect during the currency of this Policy without  alteration of terms or conditions except for any reduction of the aggregate limit or limits contained therein solely by payment of  Claims. Failure of the Insured to comply with the foregoing shall not invalidate this Policy but in the event of such failure, the Insurer  shall only be liable to the same extent as it would have been had the Insured so maintained Specified Underlying Insurance. 6.10  Inspection & Audit The Insurer shall be permitted to inspect the Insured’s property and operations at any time. Neither the Insurer’s right to make  inspections nor the making thereof nor any report thereon shall constitute an undertaking, on behalf of or for the benefit of the  Insured or others, to determine or warrant that such property or operations are safe. The Insurer may examine and audit the Insured’s books and records at any time during the Period of Insurance and extensions  thereof and within three years after the final termination of this Policy, as far as they relate to the subject matter of this insurance. 6.11  Premium 6.12  Changes 6.13  Cancellation  Unless otherwise provided the premium for this Policy is a flat premium and is not subject to adjustment except as provided in this  condition.  In the event of additional insured parties, or additional risk or cover, being added to the coverage under any of the underlying  insurances during the currency of this Policy, prompt notice shall be given to the Insurer and the Insurer shall be entitled to  charge an appropriate additional premium if required. Subject always to Conditions 6.13 and 6.21 notice to or knowledge possessed by any person shall not effect a waiver or change in  any part of this Policy or stop the Insurer from asserting any rights under the terms of this Policy, nor shall the terms of this Policy  be waived or changed, except by Endorsement issued to form a part hereof, signed by an authorised representative of the Insurer. This Policy may be cancelled at any time at the request of the Insured in which case the Insurer shall retain premium  commensurate with the risk attaching for the period the Policy was in force. The Insurer may also cancel this Policy on any grounds subject to the Insurance Contracts Act where the Insurer has given the  Insured written notice of such cancellation in accordance with that Act. The Insurer’s notice of cancellation takes effect at the earlier of the following times: 6.13.1  the time when another policy of insurance between the Insured and the Insurer or some other insurer, being a policy  that is intended by the Insured to replace this Policy, is entered into; or 6.13.2  4.00 PM on the thirtieth business day after the day on which notice was given to the Insured.

      "6.21  Cross Liability, Severability and Waiver of Subrogation This Policy, including any amendment, renewal or variation or Endorsement of it, shall be construed as if each insured party had  made a proposal, application or request for the Policy, amendment, renewal, variation or Endorsement in respect of their interest  only. Further, any information or knowledge possessed by one insured party, whether possessed before or after the contract was  entered into, shall not be imputed to any other such party. The Insurer will not seek any relief whatsoever (including cancellation  of the Policy) for non-disclosure and/or misrepresentation against an insured party unless the Insurer would have been entitled to  that relief had that party been the only party covered by this Policy. Further, neither the inclusion of more than one Insured under this Policy nor any act, omission, breach or default by any Insured  shall in any way affect the rights of any other Insured, it being intended that this Policy shall be construed as if a separate contract  of insurance has been entered into by each Insured; but not so as to increase the Limit of Liability. All right of subrogation is waived under this Policy against every company, organisation and person defined as an Insured under  this Policy to which or to whom protection is afforded under the Policy.  6.22  Goods and Services Tax (GST) GST, Input Tax Credit, Acquisition and Supply have the same meaning as given to those expressions in A New Tax System (Goods  and Services Tax) Act 1999 and related legislation as amended from time to time. Taxable Percentage is the Insured’s entitlement to an Input Tax Credit on the Premium as a percentage of the total GST on that Premium. 6.22.1  Where the Insurer makes a payment under this Policy for the Acquisition of goods, services or other Supply, the amount  of the payment will be reduced by the amount of any Input Tax Credit that the Insured is, or will be, entitled to in  relation to that Acquisition, whether or not the Insured makes that Acquisition. 6.22.2  Where the Insurer makes a payment under this Policy as Compensation instead of payment for the Acquisition of goods,  services or other Supply, the Insurer will reduce the amount of the payment by the amount of any Input Tax Credit that the  Insured would have been entitled to had the payment been applied to acquire such goods, services or other Supply. Any GST amount paid by the Insurer shall be in addition to the Limit of Liability. No payment shall be made to the Insured for any GST liability that they may acquire upon settlement of a Claim if the Insured has  not informed the Insurer of its correct Taxable Percentage. 6.23  Self Insured Retention reimbursement The Insured shall promptly reimburse the Insurer for any amount of Self Insured Retention (excepting Defence Costs and  Supplementary Payments as specified within Clause 1.2) paid by the Insurer on behalf of the Insured.  16  \n",

      "IMPORTANT NOTICES  DUTY OF DISCLOSURE    Before you (the Insured) enter into a contract of general insurance (which includes this General and Products Liability Insurance  Policy) you have a duty under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 to disclose to the Insurer every matter that you know, or could  reasonably be expected to know, is relevant to the Insurer’s decision whether to accept the risk of the insurance and, if so, on  what terms.    You have the same duty to disclose those matters to the Insurer before you renew, extend, vary or reinstate a contract of general  insurance.    that diminishes the risk to be undertaken by the Insurer;  INFORMATION YOU DO NOT NEED TO GIVE    Your duty, however, does not require disclosure of any matter:    •     •     •     •     that is of common knowledge;  as to which compliance with your duty is waived by the Insurer.  that the Insurer knows or, in the ordinary course of its business, ought to know;  NON-DISCLOSURE    If you fail to comply with the duty of disclosure, the Insurer may be entitled to reduce its liability under the contract in respect of a  claim or may cancel the contract.    If your non-disclosure is fraudulent, the Insurer may also have the option of avoiding the contract from its beginning.    DEDUCTIBLE    A Deductible is the amount of a claim for which you are responsible.  Usually an amount is deducted from each claim with the  Insurer settling the balance.      On occasions, agreement may be reached with the Insurer that you will bear an annual aggregate Deductible. This means that  you will bear all claims during the Period of Insurance until the amount of that  Deductible has been reached.  Thereafter the  Insurer is responsible for the full amount of each claim (unless stated otherwise in the Policy) which may arise out of Personal  Injury, Property Damage or Advertising Injury which takes place prior to the expiry of the Period of Insurance.    The Deductible(s) applicable to this insurance is/are set forth in the Schedule.    LIABILITY ASSUMED UNDER AN AGREEMENT    You are hereby advised that it is not possible to transfer to the Insurer the entire spectrum of legal liabilities which you  may be  compelled  to  bear  under  the  terms  of  a  wide  variety  of  Indemnity  and/or  Hold  Harmless  Clauses  frequently  inserted  into  commercial business contracts by principals, lessors or other parties.    Liability  assumed  by  you  under  an  agreement  is  covered  only  to  the  extent  described  in  this  General  and  Products  Liability  Insurance Policy.    Prior to accepting legal liability for loss, destruction, damage or injury, which would not otherwise have attached to you at law,  you should contact Willis Australia Limited or the Insurer to enquire whether this General and Products Liability Insurance Policy  covers such liability or, if not, whether it may be so extended.

      "4.3  The Insurer’s Rights Regarding Claims  4.3.1  Following the happening of any Occurrence in respect of which a claim is, or may be, made under  this Policy, the Insurer shall have full discretion in the conduct of any proceedings in connection  with  any  claim.  The  Insured  shall  give  such  information  and  assistance  that  the  Insurer  may  reasonably require in the prosecution, defence or settlement of any claim.  4.3.2  The Insurer may at any time pay to the Insured, in respect of all claims against the Insured arising  directly or indirectly from one source or original cause:  4.3.2.1  4.3.2.2  the amount of the Limit of Liability or such other amount specified in respect thereof  (after  deduction  of  any  sum(s)  already  paid  by  the  Insurer,  which  sum(s)  would  reduce the amount of the Insurer’s unfulfilled liability in respect thereof); or   any lesser sum for which the claim(s) can be settled.  4.3.3  Upon making such payment, the Insurer shall relinquish conduct and control of, and be under no  further  liability  under  this  Policy  in  connection  with,  such  claim(s)  except  for  Defence  Costs  and  Supplementary Payments:   4.3.3.1  4.3.3.2  recoverable  from  the  Insured  in  respect  of  the  period  prior  to  the  date  of  such  payment (whether or not pursuant to an order made subsequently); or    incurred  by  the  Insurer,  or  by  the  Insured  with  the  written  consent  of  the  Insurer,  prior to the date of such payment.  4.4  Goods and Services Tax  The Insured must inform the Insurer of the extent to which the Insured is entitled to an  input tax credit for the  premium each time that the Insured makes a claim under this Policy.  No payment will be made to the Insured  for any GST liability that arises on the settlement of a claim under this Policy when the Insured has not informed  the Insurer of the Insured’s entitlement or correct entitlement to an input tax credit.    Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  this  Policy  (including  the  Schedule  and  any  endorsements  attached  hereto) to the contrary, the Insurer’s liability will be calculated after taking into account:    any  input  tax  credit  to  which  the  Insured,  or  any  claimant  against  the  Insured,  is  entitled  for  any  acquisition relevant to a claim paid under this Policy, and  any  input  tax  credit  to  which  the  Insured,  or  any  claimant  against  the  Insured,  would  have  been  entitled were the Insured or the claimant to have made a relevant acquisition; and  the GST amount of any supply made by the Insured which is relevant to the Insured’s claim.  4.4.1    4.4.2    4.4.3  If the applicable Limit of Liability is not sufficient to cover the Insured’s claim, the Insurer will only pay GST (less  any relevant input tax credit) that relates to the Insurer’s proportion of any claim.  The terms “GST”, “input tax credit”, “acquisition” and “supply” have the meanings ascribed to them in the A New  Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999.  Nothing  herein  contained  shall  be  held  to  vary,  alter,  waive  or  extend  any  of  the  terms,  Claims  Conditions,  Exclusions or Definitions of this Policy other than as stated above.

The Insured shall, where requested by the Insurer after the expiry of each Period of Insurance, provide to the  Insurer  such  particulars  and  information  as  the  Insurer  may  require  as  soon  as  reasonably  practicable.  The  premium for such Period shall thereupon be adjusted and any difference paid by or allowed to the Insured, as  the case may be, subject to retention by the Insurer of any minimum premium that may have been agreed upon  between the Insurer and the Insured at inception or the last renewal date of this Policy.  5.2  Alteration of Risk  Every  change  which  substantially  varies  any  of  the  material  facts  or  circumstances  existing  at  the  commencement  of  each  Period  of  Insurance,  that  shall  come  to  the  knowledge  of  the  Insured’s  officer  responsible for insurance matters, shall be notified to the Insurer as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter  and  the  Insured  shall  (if  so  requested)  pay  such  reasonable  additional  premium  as  may  be  required  by  the  Insurer.  5.3       Acquisition of Properties or Companies    The indemnity granted by this policy extends to properties, assets, companies, firms, entities or other bodies  formed  or  acquired  by  the  Insured  or  of  which  the  Insured  assumes  management  responsibility  during  the  Period of Insurance.

Bankruptcy or Insolvency  In  the  event  of  the  bankruptcy  or  insolvency  of  the  Insured  or  any  entity  comprising  the  Insured,  the  Insurer  shall  not  be  relieved  thereby  of  the  payment  of  any  claims  hereunder  because  of  such  bankruptcy  or  insolvency.

Cancellation  By the Insured  5.6.1  By the Insurer    5.6.2  This Policy may be terminated at any time by the Insured tendering notice in writing to the Insurer  to that effect, in which event the cancellation will become effective from the earlier of the date the  notice is received by the Insurer or the date on which the Insured arranged alternative insurance  protection.   Subject to General Conditions 5.5 and 5.14 of this Policy, the Insurer may cancel this Policy in any  of  the  circumstances  set  out  in  Sections  60  or  61  of  the  Insurance  Contracts  Act  1984  (as  amended).    Such cancellation shall take effect at the earlier of the following times:  5.6.2.1  the time when another policy of insurance between the Insured and the Insurer or  some  other  insurer,  being  a  policy  that  is  intended  by  the  Insured  to  replace  this  Policy, is entered into; or  5.6.2.2  at 4.00 p.m. on the thirtieth (30th) business day after the day on which notification  was given to the Insured.  In the event of cancellation of this Policy by either party, the Insured shall be entitled to a pro rata refund of  premium subject to any minimum and deposit premium that may apply.    If the premium is subject to adjustment, cancellation will not affect the obligation of the Insured to supply the  Insurer with such information as is necessary to permit the premium adjustment to be calculated.  This insurance extends to indemnify each of the Insureds hereunder separately in the same manner and to a  like extent as though policies had been issued in their  separate  names. In particular, but without limiting the  foregoing,  this  insurance  shall  indemnify  each  of  the  parties  described  under  Definition  2.13  of  this  Policy  in  respect of claims made by any other of such parties.     5.7    Cross Liabilities        WillPlace Liability September 2011       \n",
